# Inspect

The Ledger is integrated with Fuchsia's Inspect system.

# Use

`iquery` is the utility used by developers to read data exposed by a running
Ledger binary. A typical command may look something like
 ```
$ fx shell iquery --find /hub/c/ledger.cmx/*/out/inspect
/hub/c/ledger.cmx/4042026/out/inspect
```
or
```
$ fx shell iquery --ls /hub/c/ledger.cmx/4042026/out/inspect#repositories/4B0958A113F62EF7AF81988906CC847F/ledgers/modular_sessionmgr
pages
```
A particular "dump everything" recipe to keep handy is
```
$ fx shell iquery --cat --recursive /hub/c/ledger.cmx/*/out/inspect
```
This will show all data exposed by all discovered Ledger processes.

# Extension

As the Ledger exposes data to Inspect by maintaining a hierarchy of
[`Node`](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/c5c27602444f96b3147108d7fdaf1823e7e353fe/garnet/public/lib/inspect_deprecated/inspect.h#443)
instances to which properties, metrics, and other `Node` instances are attached,
exposing additional data entails adding more Inspect object instances to those
already-present `Node`s. For example, we might add an indication of whether
peer-to-peer sync is present or absent for a given ledger by adding a
[`StringProperty`](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/c5c27602444f96b3147108d7fdaf1823e7e353fe/garnet/public/lib/inspect_deprecated/inspect.h#295)
member to `LedgerManager` and instantiating it in the `LedgerManager`
constructor with
```C++
sync_property_(inspect_node_.CreateStringProperty(kSyncInspectPathComponent.ToString(),
                                                  ledger_sync_ ? "present" : "absent")),
```

## Children Managers

At several points in our hierarchy we make use of [the `ChildrenManager` API](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/c5c27602444f96b3147108d7fdaf1823e7e353fe/garnet/public/lib/inspect_deprecated/inspect.h#582)
to enable Inspect's dynamically querying and discovering parts of our hierarchy
that are disk-resident or otherwise latent rather than immediately maintained in
memory. An instance of a `ChildrenManager` implementation is scoped to a single
`Node` and offers Inspect two methods: `GetNames`, which describes names of
children available under the node, and `Attach`, which adds a named child to the
hierarchy (and keeps it in the hierarchy until Inspect signals that it is done
examining it). For example, `LedgerManager`'s implementation of `GetNames` scans
the disk for the names of directories representing pages but only its
implementation of `Attach` actually brings up a `PageManager` for a page.

# Demo

Need help getting started? Demo-it-yourself by following these steps:
* Build a `workstation` configuration with a few extra packages:
   ```
   $ fx set workstation.x64 --with=//topaz,//garnet/packages:all,//peridot/packages:all
   ```
* Bring up the device:
   ![login screen after bringup](device-bringup.png)
* Execute
   ```
   $ fx shell iquery --cat --recursive /hub/c/ledger.cmx/*/out/inspect
   ```
   and observe that the command fails because there is not yet a Ledger binary
   running anywhere on the system.
* Execute
   ```
   $ fx shell sessionctl login_guest
   ```
   to log in:
   ![screen after logging in as guest](after-guest-login.png)
* Execute
   ```
   $ fx shell iquery --cat --recursive /hub/c/ledger.cmx/*/out/inspect
   ```
   again, and observe output generally appearing as
   ```

   . Note that there's a lot going on here:
   * A Ledger binary is now running on the system! Just one, that's what the one
      `ledger_component` appearing at hierarchical-top-level (least-indented)
      means in the output.
   * There is just one repository. Repositories are scoped to users, and we just
      logged in as the single guest user, so it would be a surprise to see more
      or fewer repositories.
   * There are three ledgers, each with a name that easily identifies the binary
      with which it is associated:
      * `fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/clipboard_agent#meta/clipboard_agent.cmx`
      * `fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/discovermgr#meta/discovermgr.cmx`
      * `modular_sessionmgr`
   * While no entries have yet been written by anyone, the ledgers differ in
      that `fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/clipboard_agent#meta/clipboard_agent.cmx`
      and `fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/discovermgr#meta/discovermgr.cmx` each
      store only the root page, but `modular_sessionmgr` stores the root page
      plus two other pages of its own naming (`AgentRunnerPage_` and
      `MessageQueuePage`).
* Execute
   ```
   $ fx shell 'sessionctl --story_name="My-TODO" --mod_name="my_todo_list" add_mod "fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/todo_list#meta/todo_list.cmx"'
   ```
   to bring up the `todo_list` mod:
   ![empty Todo List mod](empty-todo-list.png)
* Execute
   ```
   $ fx shell iquery --cat --recursive /hub/c/ledger.cmx/*/out/inspect

   a fifth time, and observe that the output is exactly the same as the last
   execution - as long as the data is disk-resident and a `LedgerRepository`
   scoped to the user is in memory, Inspect and `iquery` will be able to locate
   it.
* Execute

* Execute
   ```
   $ fx shell iquery --cat --recursive /hub/c/ledger.cmx/*/out/inspect
   ```
   one last time, and again observe that (as was the case before logging in)
   Inspect is not able to find anything because there is no running Ledger
   binary.

# How To Cautiously Explore Without Traversing Everything, Inflating Everything, And Exhausting Memory
* Use `iquery --find` (without `--recursive`) to determine [the values against
   which the asterisks in other commands match](https://bugs.fuchsia.dev/p/fuchsia/issues/detail?id=36554):
   ```
   $ fx shell iquery --find /hub/c/ledger.cmx/*/out/inspect
   /hub/c/ledger.cmx/1896955/out/inspect
   ```
* Then use `iquery --cat` to view the properties and metrics attached to each
   node and `iquery --ls` to view the direct children of each node:
   ```
   $ fx shell iquery --find /hub/c/ledger.cmx/*/out/inspect
   /hub/c/ledger.cmx/1896955/out/inspect
   $ fx shell iquery --ls /hub/c/ledger.cmx/1896955/out/inspect#repositories
