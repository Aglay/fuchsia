# Testing

This document describes different test types used in Ledger.

*** note
All of the tests run on a Fuchsia device (real or emulated). For the tests below
we indicate the commands to trigger the execution from the host machine, but the
execution itself happens on the target.

[TOC]

## TL;DR

For testing on an x64 device:
```sh
fx set core.x64 --with //src/ledger:tests \
 --variant asan/ledger_unittests --variant asan/ledger_integration_tests \
 --variant asan/ledger_e2e_local --variant asan/ledger \
 --variant asan/ledger_lib_unittests --variant asan/cloud_provider_in_memory \
 --variant asan/cloud_provider_validation_tests
fx run-test ledger_tests
```

This command will run the following tests, that are enabled by default:

* [unit tests](#unit-tests)
* [integration tests](#integration-tests)
* [local end-to-end tests](#local-e2e)
* [Ledger lib] unit tests
* [Cloud provider validation tests] for the in-memory cloud provider

It will not run the following tests, that need to be configured and executed
manually:

* [performance tests][benchmarks]
* [fuzz tests](#fuzz-tests)

It will also enable [Address Sanitizer] for ledger tests.

You can run only [specific tests][gtest_filter] with `--gtest_filter`:
```
fx run-test ledger_tests -- --gtest_filter=FooTest.*
```

## Unit tests

**Unit tests** are low-level tests written against the smallest testable parts
of the code. Tests for `some_class.{h,cc}` are placed side-by-side the code
being tested, in a `some_class_unittest.cc` file.

Unit tests are regular [Google Test] tests. Most of them use our own
[TestLoopFixture] base class to conveniently run them with a fake clock, and
simulated multi-thread, in order to know when nothing will ever happen again.

All unit tests in the Ledger tree are built into a single `ledger_unittests`
binary. The binary is self-contained: it contains both the tests and the Ledger
logic under test linked into a single Google Test binary.

You can run it from the host with:

```sh
fx run-test ledger_tests -t ledger_unittests
```

## Integration tests

**Integration tests** are written against client-facing FIDL services exposed by
Ledger, although these services still run in the same process as the test code.

Integration tests inherit from [IntegrationTest] and are placed under
[/bin/ledger/tests/integration].

All integration tests in the Ledger tree are built into a single
`ledger_integration_tests` binary. You can run it from the host:

```sh
fx run-test ledger_tests -t ledger_integration_tests
```

*** aside
Some of the integration tests emulate multiple Ledger instances synchronizing
data with each other. Through advanced build magic and [testing abstractions],
these are run both as integration tests (against fake in-memory implementation
of the cloud provider interface), and as end-to-end synchronization tests
(against a real server).
***

## End-to-end tests

**End-to-end tests** are also written against client-facing FIDL services
exposed by Ledger, but in this case the test code runs in a separate process,
and connects to Ledger the same way any other client application would do. This
is the highest-level way of testing that exercises all of the Ledger stack.

### Local tests {#local-e2e}

End-to-end tests not depending on cross-device synchronization are called "local
end-to-end tests" and are defined in [/bin/ledger/tests/e2e_local]. All local
end-to-end tests are built into a single `ledger_e2e_local` binary. You can run
it from the host:

```sh
fx run-test ledger_tests -t ledger_e2e_local
```

## Performance tests

For performance tests, see [benchmarks].

## Fuzz tests

Ledger uses LibFuzzer for fuzz tests. We have a single fuzz package called
`ledger_fuzzers`. It can be built as follows:

```sh
fx set core.x64 --with //src/ledger:tests --fuzz-with asan
fx build
```

And then run:

```sh
fx push-package ledger_fuzzers
fx fuzz start ledger
```

You can refer to the full [fuzzing] instructions for details.
