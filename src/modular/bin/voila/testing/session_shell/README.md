# Voila testing session shell

This directory contains a minimal compliant implementation of the session shell
interface, that only displays "Hello, world" and does not actually run any
stories. This can be then used in Voila tests, to verify that view embedding
works correctly and "Hello, world" is indeed displayed in each replica.
