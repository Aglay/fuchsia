# The complete set of packages needed to build a system image which runs
# Dachsiaboard at system startup. This is intentionally not tested on CQ
# and not included in any existing product configuration. Images are built
# manually by the infra team on top of the core product during initial
# device setup. It depends on low-level packages that support many other
# users and use-cases, so should be fairly stable, but ultimately infra is
# on the hook for monitoring and maintaining this target.
#
# To build, use:
#   fx set core.x64 --release --with-base=//src/developer/dachsiaboard:bundle
