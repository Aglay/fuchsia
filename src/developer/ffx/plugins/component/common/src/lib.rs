pub const SELECTOR_FORMAT_HELP: &str =
    "Selector format: <component moniker>:(in|out|exposed)[:<service name>].
Wildcards may be used anywhere in the selector.

Example: 'remote-control:out:*' would return all services in 'out' for
the component remote-control.

Note that moniker wildcards are not recursive: 'a/*/c' will only match
components named 'c' running in some sub-realm directly below 'a', and
no further.";
