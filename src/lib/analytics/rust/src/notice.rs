Fuchsia core developer tools use Google Analytics to report feature usage
statistics and basic crash reports. Google may examine the collected data
in aggregate to help improve these tools, other Fuchsia tools, and the
Fuchsia SDK.

Analytics are not sent on this very first run. To disable reporting, type

    ffx config analytics disable

To display the current setting and what is collected, type

    ffx config analytics

If you opt out of analytics, an opt-out event will be sent, and then no
further information will be sent by the core developer tools to Google.

By using Fuchsia core developer tools, you agree to the Google Terms of Service.
