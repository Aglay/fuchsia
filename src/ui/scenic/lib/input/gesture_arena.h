// Class for deciding Gesture Disambiguation contests.
// On construction the arena takes a list of all the clients contending, in priority order, for the
// stream. The arena then receives responses for the every contender, and uses these in
// combination with priority to decide the owner ("winner") of the stream.
//
// Intended use:
// InputSystem creates one GestureArena every time a new stream begins, designating contenders
// for that stream at construction.
// Each time a new set of events arrives for the stream InputSystem should call UpdateStream() with
// the number of new events as well a bool telling the arena whether there will be any more events.
// RecordResponse() should be called once for each event for every contender (until the contender
// has been designated either a winner or a loser). With every call the arena makes an attempt at
// determining a winner, returning a ContestResults struct containing any new results from
// the contest.
// The GestureArena should be destroyed after the contest ends, at which point stream events
// can be sent directly to the winner.
