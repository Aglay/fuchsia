  // This function is for registering collections that contain render targets. In order for an image
  // to be used as a render target in the Render() function below, the buffer collection it
  // is associated with must have been registered with this function.

  // This function is likewise threadsafe, although it is only meant to be called from the render
  // loop, and not by any flatland instance directly.

  // This function validates if the buffer collection referenced by |collection_id| is ready to
  // be used in rendering operations and must be called before that buffer collection is used
  // in |Render|. Specifically, this function checks to make sure that the buffer collection is
  // fully allocated (which can only happen after all token holders have set constraints and the
  // client has requested for sysmem to allocate the buffer collection via a call to
  // WaitForBuffersAllocated() or an equivalent function).
  //
  // If the collection has not yet been fully allocated, or if the collection has not been
  // registered with the renderer via a call to RegisterBufferCollection(), this function will
  // return std::nullopt. If the collection has been registered and has been fully allocated, then
  // this function will return a BufferCollectionMetadata struct containing information pertaining
  // to the number of vmos as well as image constraints, such as maximum width/height (see
  // BufferCollectionMetadata at the top of this file for more information).
  //
  // The BufferCollectionMetadata can then be used by the Flatland instance to verify images it
  // wishes to create with this buffer collection. Images map N:1 with buffer collections, since a
  // collection can consist of multiple VMOs, and each VMO in turn can back multiple images. The
  // intended usage then is for the Flatland instance to store the BufferCollectionMetadata it
  // receives and use it to compare against any incoming images. For example, if a buffer collection
  // only has 5 VMOs and an image is referencing vmo index 6, then that would be an error.
  //
  // This function needs to be separate from RegisterBufferCollection() since it is too early to
  // return a |BufferCollectionMetadata| struct at registration time., as the client may have not
  // yet set their constraints, or duplicated their token. Combining this function with the above
  // registration function would require us to block on registration, which could go on forever.
  //
  // Lastly, this function needs to communicate with sysmem and may take some time. However, it does
  // not block indefinitely. Additionally, it only needs to be called once per buffer collection if
  // the call was successful. It is up to the Flatland instance how to proceed in the event of
  // failure. Calling this function multiple times until it returns true is allowed.

  // Flatland instance thread. The specific behavior may differ depending on the specific subclass
  // implementation, which may also be a null renderer.
  //
  // This function assumes that clients have already validated their input data by comparing it
  // against the BufferCollectionMetadata received from calling |Validate| above. This function
  // will abort if invalid data has been passed in or if |Validate| has never been called.
