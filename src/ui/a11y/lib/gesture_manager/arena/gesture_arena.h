// The Gesture Arena for accessibility services.
//
// The Gesture Arena manages several recognizers which are trying to interpret a
// gesture that is being performed. It respects the following rules:
// 1. The first recognizer to claim a win, wins.
// 2. The last recognizer to be in the arena wins.
//
// Any recognizer can declare win or defeat at any time. Once a recognizer has
// won the arena for that gesture, it receives incoming pointer events until it
// tells the arena that it has finished processing pointer events.
//
// The order in which recognizers are added to the arena is important. When
// routing pointer events to recognizers, they see the event in order they were
// added. Then they have the chance to claim a win before the next recognizer in
// the list has the chance to act.
// If a recognizer claims a win and is successful, this means that all other
// recognizers will be defeated and will be notified via a OnDefeat() call.
//
// In this model, it is important to notice that there are two layers of
// abstraction:
// 1. Raw pointer events, which come from the input system, arrive at the arena
// and are dispatched to arena members via a PointerEventRouter.
// 2. Gestures, which are sequences of pointer events with a semantic meaning,
// are identified by recognizers.
//
// With that in mind, each recognizer defines the semantic meaning for the
// sequence of pointer events that it is receiving. In another words, it is
// expected that a recognizer could identify a single tap, another a double tap,
// and so on.
//
// For this reason, winning the gesture arena **does not mean** that the
// recognizer identified a gesture. It only means that it has the right to
// interpret the raw pointer events, and give a semantic meaning to them if it
// wants to.
// Consider an arena with only one recognizer, which, by the rules above, would
// be a winner by the default. It would process incoming pointer events and
// detect its gesture only when the gesture actually occurred.
//
// Implementation notes: this arena is heavily influenced by Fluttter's gesture
// arena: https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/advanced/gestures
// For those familiar how Flutter version works, here are the important main
// differences:
// 1. It does not implement a sweep logic, which means that all recognizers must
// not be passive -- in another words, they always must at some point call
// ClaimWin() or DeclareDefeat(), as the arena will never force a resolution
// when all pointer IDs have stopped contacting the screen.
// 2. The arena here is not per finger (AKA per pointer ID), which means that
// recognizers receive the whole interaction with the screen.
