# benchmarks

This directory contains wrapper code for running Fuchsia benchmarks.

TODO(fxb/23091): This will eventually be replaced by the [SL4F
versions of the benchmarks](/src/tests/end_to_end/perf/).

To run a benchmark on CI and upload its results to the performance
dashboard, add an entry in benchmarks.cc.
