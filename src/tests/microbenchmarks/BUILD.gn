# Installing this package causes fuchsia_microbenchmarks to be run in unit
# test mode (fast mode) via runtests.
#
# This package requires fuchsia_microbenchmarks_perftestmode to also be
# installed.
#
# This package's copy of fuchsia_microbenchmarks invokes both itself
# (fuchsia_microbenchmarks) and fdio_spawn_helper as subprocesses, but it
# does so via the redirector executables in /bin (via the shell-commands
# package).  Those point to the copies of those executables in
# fuchsia_microbenchmarks_perftestmode, which is why that package is
# required.
#
# Since Fuchsia packages cannot declare dependencies on other packages, GN
# targets that require fuchsia_microbenchmarks_unittestmode should depend
# on the fuchsia_microbenchmarks group() instead.
#
# The reason for splitting fuchsia_microbenchmarks into two packages like
# this is that we don't want to run fuchsia_microbenchmarks in unit test
# mode on the terminal-x64-release builder that runs SL4F tests, for two
# reasons:
#
#  1) The unit tests run on other builders, so it's unnecessary to run them
#     a second time.
#  2) Running unit tests on the terminal-x64-release builder currently does
#     not work: It results in the creation of a shard to run tests under
#     QEMU, but running Fuchsia on QEMU on that builder does not work
#     (perhaps because of missing dependencies).
