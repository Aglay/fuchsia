# Generates two `source_set` definitions, for use with and without the ddk.
#
# This template allows us to have a different source_set definition for targets that will become a
# driver and targets that will not. Notably, network-device libraries' tests and the network-tun
# component use the source_set without the DDK symbols.
#
# The DDK target will have DDK libraries added to its public deps and `NETDEV_DDK` to its defines.
# The non-DDK target will have the syslog library added to its public deps. Both targets have the
# `_ALL_SOURCE` define added.
#
# Parameters
# - sources and public_deps work as expected.
