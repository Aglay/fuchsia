// - How do we detect circular routes? Do we attempt to detect at rule
//   installation time? At runtime? Using what algorithm?

// NOTE on loopback addresses: Loopback addresses should be handled before
// reaching the forwarding table. For that reason, we do not prevent a rule
// whose subnet is a subset of the loopback subnet from being installed; they
// will never get triggered anyway, so implementing the logic of detecting these
// rules is a needless complexity.
