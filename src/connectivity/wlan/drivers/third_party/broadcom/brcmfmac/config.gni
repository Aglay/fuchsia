# Firmware file copying below.  There are three targets:
#
# * brcmfmac-firmware-copy
# * brcmfmac-nvram-copy
# * brcmfmac-clm-copy
#
# which copy the firmware, NVRAM definition, and CLM blob respectively.  They are either copy()
# targets, or empty group() targets, for use in the driver_driver_package() targets below.
#
# All files that must be included as libraries in the driver_driver_package() target are added to the
# driver_library_files list.
