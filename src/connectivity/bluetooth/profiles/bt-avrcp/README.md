# Bluetooth Profile: AVRCP

This component implements the Audio Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP) as
specified by the Bluetooth SIG in the [official specification](https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=457082).

The `bt-avrcp` component is a system service that is created when needed - typically as a side effect of launching the [bt-a2dp-sink](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/refs/heads/master/src/connectivity/bluetooth/profiles/bt-a2dp-sink/) or [bt-avrcp-target](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/refs/heads/master/src/connectivity/bluetooth/profiles/bt-avrcp-target/) components. Once launched, `bt-avrcp` will persist until explicitly terminated.

The component registers both the Controller (CT) and Target (TG) roles with the BR/EDR [Profile](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/refs/heads/master/sdk/fidl/fuchsia.bluetooth.bredr/profile.fidl) Service.

## Build configuration

Follow the steps for the A2DP sink profile and add this module to your build with
```--with //src/connectivity/bluetooth/profiles/bt-avrcp``` to include AVRCP with your build.

It's recommended to include the bt-avrcp-controller package to provide a simple REPL to send AVRCP
commands to peers either by including the bt tools package in your build or directly with
```--with //src/connectivity/bluetooth/tools/bt-avrcp-controller```

eg: `fx set core.x64 --with //src/media/bundles:services --with //src/connectivity/bluetooth/tools/bt-avrcp-controller --with src/connectivity/bluetooth/profiles/bt-avrcp --with //src/connectivity/bluetooth/profiles/bt-a2dp-sink`


## Using AVRCP from the shell

1. AVRCP doesn't start automatically and service manager should launch the `bt_avrcp` service.
The best way to do that today is by running the `bt-avrcp-controller` tool from the Fuchsia shell
with a fake peer id and then immediately exiting the shell.

    Eg:

    ```
    #> bt-avrcp-controller 12345
    avrcp# exit
    >
    ```

1. Start the `bt-a2dp-sink` service with `run -d fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/bt-a2dp-sink#meta/bt-a2dp-sink.cmx`

1. (If you haven't paired previously) pair your fuchsia device with your test device -
    - Make the fuchsia device discoverable but running run `bt-cli` from the fuchsia shell.
    - Use the `discoverable` command to make the fuchsia device discoverable
    - Once your device is paired exit the bt-cli with the `exit` command.

1. Obtain the peer id for the paired device
    - Run the `bt-cli` from the fuchsia shell.
    - Use the `list-peers` commands in bt-cli and copy down the peer ID.
    - Exit bt-cli with the `exit` command.

1. Run `bt-avrcp-controller <peer id>` (using the peer id from bt-cli) to obtain a controller for
the peer.

1. Issue commands to the peer using the AVRCP tool. Use the `help` command to get a list of
supported commands available.

## Code Layout

### `peer` mod

#### `PeerManager` and `PeerManagerInner` objects

* Central hub of AVRCP.
* `PeerManager` contains all business logic for connection state management to the peers.
  Additionally handles the primary select loop for the AVRCP service and all associated event
  channels from the profile and service mods.
* `PeerManagerInner` holds a collection of RemotePeer objects that represent all peers that have
  been discovered or have been requested by the FIDL service. This object holds the state
  for all peers. It's intended to be thread safe and shared across all internal objects in the peer
  mod to interact with the peers.


#### `RemotePeer` object
* Contains the the discovered service attributes of the peer as reported by the BR/EDR service.
* Owns any associated connections currently open to the peer.
* Contains a vector of controller listener channels waiting for any incoming notifications by the
  peer. Events received by the peer are dispatched to all listening control listeners.
* Owns a command handler (ControlChannelCommandHandler) to respond to incoming AVC commands from the
  peer. Depending on the role we are functioning in after doing SDP discovery, this command handler
  will dispatch events to media session when functioning as AVRCP Target or to an absolute volume
  handler for the peer if one is registered.

#### `PeerController` objects
* Public interface vended by peer manager to service and test frontends to communicate with a
  specific peer.
* Encapsulates communication with peer manager to send commands requests to a peer and to handle
  the responses to those commands.
* Provides an event stream to receive incoming notifications from the peer.

#### `ControlChannelCommandHandler` object
* Handles AV\C commands received from the peer on the control channel.
* Primarily used when when we are acting in AVRCP target role with A2DP source or for absolute
  volume handling with A2DP sink.
* Maintains state for the peer as target for continuations and registered notifications by the peer.
* Dispatches target commands to media session or a registered test target handler for most target
  commands.
* Dispatches absolute volume commands to the registered absolute volume handler (typically A2DP
  sink).

### `service` mod
* Encapsulates and abstracts (to facilitate testing and mocking) outward facing AVRCP FIDL services
  from the peer manager.
* Handles FIDL request to obtain an AVRCP Controller for a given peer id.
* Incoming requests for a controller to a peer are dispatched to the PeerManager who in turn
  vend off a PeerController to interact with the requested peer.
* Handles setting over absolute volume handlers and test target handlers that will be registered
  into the PeerManager.

### `profile` mod
* Encapsulates and abstracts (to facilitate testing) the BR/EDR FIDL service from the peer manager.
* Sets up SDP service definitions that are registered with the BD/EDR service and service searches.
* Vends off incoming L2CAP connections and discovered peer attributes events to the peer manager and
  gives the peer manager a method for making outgoing L2CAP connections to discovered peers.

### `packets` mod
* Contains the AV\C control channel and browse channel vendor dependent specific packet
  encoders/decoders.
* Provides methods for encoding the vendor dependent header/preambles on most commands.
* Contains encoding logic for AV\C continuations/fragmentation in packet decoding and encoding of
  vendor dependent commands.
