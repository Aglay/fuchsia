// NOTE: The "witness" types UnicastAddr, MulticastAddr, and LinkLocalAddr -
// which provide the invariant that the value they contain is a unicast,
// multicast, or link-local address, respectively - cannot actually guarantee
// this property without certain promises from the implementations of the
// UnicastAddress, MulticastAddress, and LinkLocalAddress traits that they rely
// on. In particular, the values must be "immutable" in the sense that, given
// only immutable references to the values, nothing about the values can change
// such that the "unicast-ness", "multicast-ness" or "link-local-ness" of the
// values change. Since the UnicastAddress, MulticastAddress, and
// LinkLocalAddress traits are not unsafe traits, it would be unsound for unsafe
// code to rely for its soundness on this behavior. For a more in-depth
// discussion of why this isn't possible without an explicit opt-in on the part
// of the trait implementor, see this forum thread:
// https://users.rust-lang.org/t/prevent-interior-mutability/29403
