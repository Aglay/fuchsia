# Font Manifest Generator

The font manifest generator creates a `.font_manifest.json` file for use by the font server.

To see usage instructions, run
```shell
./out/default/host_x64/font_manifest_generator --help
```

## Inputs

### 1. `*.font_catalog.json`

Contains a human-written listing of font families, assets, and typefaces. See
[schema](../schemas/font_catalog.schema.json).

One `.font_catalog.json` file exists for each CIPD font repo.

These files are expected to reside in the Fuchsia source tree.

### 2. `*.font_pkgs.json`

Contains a listing of font asset names (e.g. `"Roboto-Bold.ttf"`, safe package
name suffixes (e.g. `"roboto-bold-ttf"`), and the relative path of the asset
within the [font directory](#4_font-directory).

One `.font_pkgs.json` file exists for each CIPD font repo. It is generated by
a recipe and checked out as a prebuilt, along with font files.

### 3. `*.all_fonts.json` and `*.local_fonts.json`

Contains a listing of _all_ font asset names and those that are _local_.
`all_fonts` must be a superset of `local_fonts`. `all_fonts` are made available
as ephemeral packages, while `local_fonts` are additionally bundled into the
font server's `/config/data` directory in the OTA image.

These file determines which font assets from the catalogs actually end up in the
generated manifest.

These files are generated by the GN `font_collection` template. There should be
one pair per product target.

### 4. Font directory

This is usually a directory in `//prebuilt/third_party`, and it is where the
CIPD checkout places all of the font asset files and the `*.font_pkgs.json`
files.

The manifest generator must read the font files to collect the set of code
points for each typeface.

## Testing

1. Make sure your `fx set` arguments include `--with //bundles:tests`.
1. Execute `fx build`
1. Execute:
  ```shell
  fx run-host-tests font_manifest_generator_bin_test \
  font_manifest_generator_integration_tests
  ```
