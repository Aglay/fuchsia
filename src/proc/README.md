# proc

This directory contains a POSIX compatibility layer for Fuchsia.

## Status

The scope and approach of this POSIX compatibility layer is still being
discussed and will be determined in a future RFC. For now, this directory
contains some libraries and other code that will eventually be combined into
this layer.

## TODO

1. Write an RFC to define the scope and approach of this layer.
1. Move `//src/lib/nix` to this directory.
