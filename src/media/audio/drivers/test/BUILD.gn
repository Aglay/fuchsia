      # VIM2 platform, where our audio driver for the HDMI-based audio output does not yet generate
      # position notifications, and thus cannot pass certain test cases. At this time, inability to
      # generate position notifications does not prevent audio output streaming from working
      # correctly (although it may in the future, when clocking relies on accurate correlation of
      # audio position with system monotonic_time).
      # TODO(34961): enable position notifications on VIM2 audio output.
      # VIM2 is an older platform; its audio output is HDMI-based; this is unlikely to be addressed.
