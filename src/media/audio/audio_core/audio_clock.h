class AudioClock {
 public:
  // Clock sources
  // Clocks are created and maintained by clients, or by audio_core on behalf of an audio device.
  // This is encoded in the clock's Source.
  //
  // Clock types
  // A clock's Type
  // specifies whether the clock can be rate-adjusted by AudioCore. It encodes the intention of the
  // client or the capabilities of the hardware.
  //
  // Client's choose whether to use the audio_core-supplied Optimal clock, or to supply their own
  // Custom clock. From AudioCore's standpoint, the Optimal clock is Adjustable (we provide it to
  // the client as read-only; we can adjust it as necessary). Any clock supplied by the client is
  // labelled Custom and treated (from AudioCore's standpoint) as read-only and Non-Adjustable (the
  // client can rate-adjust it, but that is outside our view). AudioCore might mark a Custom clock
  // as Hardware-Controlling (there will be at most one of these for each Adjustable Device clock),
  // but this is outside the client's control or visibility.
  //
  // Device clocks might be Adjustable as well, depending on hardware design and driver support.
  // This represents the ability of actual clock hardware to be fine-tuned via software. The
  // underlying zx::clock object is maintained by AudioCore, based on position notifications
  // from the audio driver that relate audio hardware DMA position to local monotonic clock time.
  //
  // Clock synchronization
  // When a client clock and a device clock run at slightly different rates, we error-correct in
  // order to keep them synchronized. Exactly how we do so depends on their respective types.
  //
  // If the client clock is adjustable, we reconcile clock misalignment by rate-adjusting it (even
  // if the device clock is also adjustable). This minimizes disruption to the rest of the system.
  //
  // If the device clock is adjustable, AudioCore might designate the (non-adjustable) client clock
  // as hardware-controlling, in which case we rate-adjust the device clock hardware to align the
  // device clock with the client clock. At most, only one client clock can be marked as controlling
  // that device clock. If the client clock is NOT hardware-controlling, it cannot guide our
  // adjustment of the device clock; we treat this case as if neither clock is adjustable.
  //
  // If neither clock is adjustable, we error-correct by slightly adjusting our sample-rate
  // conversion ratio (referred to as "micro-SRC"). This can occur if hardware rate-adjustment is
  // not supported by hardware, audio driver and AudioCore; it can also occur if another client
  // clock is already controlling that device clock hardware.
  //
  // Clock domains
  // A clock domain groups a set of clocks that always progress at the same rate (although they may
  // have offsets). Adjusting one clock causes all others in that same domain to respond as one.

  // Adjustable device clocks, by definition, are NOT rate-locked to the local monotonic clock and
  // must always be in a separate domain. However clock domain is distinct from adjustability.
  // A non-adjustable clock might also be in a different domain from the local monotonic clock
  // (CLOCK_DOMAIN_MONOTONIC, defined in fuchsia.hardware.audio/stream.fidl), in which case it may
  // drift relative to the system clock; all clocks in that domain would drift as one.
  //
  // Clock drift
  // AudioCore handles hardware clock drift just as it would any other clock synchronization.
  // It passes any error onward to the client clock if it can; otherwise it adjusts clock hardware
  // if possible; else it inserts software-based "micro-SRC".
  //
  // Feedback control
  // One final note: when a client adjusts the rate of a clock, or even when we adjust the clock
  // hardware's rate, we do not know the exact instant of that rate change. Our rate adjustments
  // might overshoot or undershoot our intention; thus we must track POSITION (not just rate), and
  // eliminate any error over time with a feedback control loop.

  // Results
  // Based on current PID coefficients (thus may need adjusting as we tune coefficients), our
  // worst-case position error deviation for each ppm of rate change is ~16 frac frames on the
  // "major" (immediate response) side, and ~8 frac frames on the "minor" (correct for overshoot)
  // side. This equates to about 40nsec per ppm and 20nsec per ppm at 48khz, so a sudden change of
  // 1000ppm in clock rate would cause a worst-case desync position error of about 16000 frac
  // frames, or about 2 frames, or about 40 usec.
  //
  // For very low-magnitude rate adjustment (1-2 ppm), we are slightly worse than linear and might
  // experience desync of up to +/-40nsec (16 fractional frames).
  //
  // Once we've settled back to steady state, our desync ripple is +/-20nsec (8 fractional frames).
