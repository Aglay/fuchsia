# Fuchsia Build Tools

This repository contains the hashes of a number of prebuilt tools that are used
to build Fuchsia-related projects. The actual tools themselves are located in
Google Storage.

In most cases, the `jiri` tool will download the build tools automatically
during its `update` step. To download the tools manually, run `update.sh`.
