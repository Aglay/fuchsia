# FIDL Cross-Petal Change Tests

These are tests to validate source compatibility through various changes to FIDL
libraries. They do not test binary compatibility. Tests for compiled languages
are only meant to be built, not executed, since source compatibility issues show
up at compile time.

## Transitions

Soft transitioning a FIDL library involves an initial state (**before**), an
intermediate state (**during**), and a final state (**after**). Depending on the
bindings used and the kind of change made to the FIDL library, the transition is
either [FIDL-assisted](#fidl-assisted) or [source-assisted](#source-assisted).

### FIDL-assisted {#fidl-assisted}

In a FIDL-assisted transition, you change source code while the FIDL library is
held in a transitional state (e.g., using the `Transitional` attribute). For
these transitions, we test four states:

| Time   | 1      | 2      | 3      | 4     |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- |
| FIDL   | before | during | during | after |
| Source | before | before | after  | after |

### Source-assisted {#source-assisted}

In a source-assisted transition, you change the FIDL library while source code
held is in a transitional state (e.g., using `default:` in switch statements).
This _would_ lead to testing four states:

| Time   | 1      | 2      | 3      | 4     |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- |
| FIDL   | before | before | after  | after |
| Source | before | during | during | after |

However, certain FIDL changes require a FIDL-assisted transition in some
bindings and a source-assisted transition in others. Suppose we make a change in
FIDL library _L_ requiring a FIDL-assisted transition in bindings _A_ and
source-assisted in bindings _B_. We would take the following steps:

1. Initially, _L_, _A_, and _B_ are **before**.
2. Change _B_ to **during**.
3. Change _L_ to **during**.
4. Change _A_ to **after**.
5. Change _L_ to **after**.
6. Change _B_ to **after**.

All correct ways of interleaving the steps will have _L_ and _B_ both in the
**during** state at some point. Therefore, although a FIDL **during** state is
unnecessary for a pure source-assisted transition, we must include it in tests.
Thus, we actually test 5 states for source-assisted transitions:

| Time   | 1      | 2      | 3      | 4      | 5     |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- |
| FIDL   | before | before | during | after  | after |
| Source | before | during | during | during | after |

## Libraries

Under `fidl/` there are three libraries:

- `fidl.test.before`, before the change has begun;
- `fidl.test.during`, during the transition;
- `fidl.test.after`, after the transition is complete.

## Tests

### C++

Under `cpp/` there are four binary targets testing FIDL-assisted transitions:

- `cpp_before` compiles `cpp/before.cc` against `fidl.test.before`
- `cpp_during_1` compiles `cpp/before.cc` against `fidl.test.during`
- `cpp_during_2` compiles `cpp/after.cc` against `fidl.test.during`
- `cpp_after` compiles `cpp/after.cc` against `fidl.test.after`

There are currently no tests for C++ source-assisted transitions.

### Go

Under `go/` there is a single package testing FIDL-assisted transitions. The
package has client code:

- `client_1_before.go` tests client code against `fidl.test.before`.
- `client_2_before_during.go` is generated by `update-during.sh`.
- `client_3_after_during.go` is generated by `update-during.sh`.
- `client_4_after.go` tests client code against `fidl.test.after`.

And server code:

- `server_1_before.go` tests server code against `fidl.test.before`.
- `server_2_before_during.go` is generated by `update-during.sh`.
- `server_3_after_during.go` is generated by `update-during.sh`.
- `server_4_after.go` tests server code against `fidl.test.after`.

There are currently no tests for Go source-assisted transitions.

### Rust

Under `rust/` there is a single library testing both FIDL-assisted transitions:

- `fidl_assisted/main.rs` executes macros from the other two modules.
- `fidl_assisted/before.rs` defines the macro `before_impl`.
- `fidl_assisted/after.rs` defines the macro `after_impl`.

And source-assisted transitions:

- `source_assisted/main.rs` executes macros from the other three modules.
- `source_assisted/before.rs` defines the macro `before_impl`.
- `source_assisted/during.rs` defines the macro `during_impl`.
- `source_assisted/after.rs` defines the macro `after_impl`.

The macros allow for building the same code against different FIDL libraries
without repetition.
