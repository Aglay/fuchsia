# Fuchsia Package Metadata

The Fuchsia package format contains an extensive metadata directory. This
document describes the metadata extensions that are understood by Fuchsia
itself.

See [https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/pm#Structure-of-a-Fuchsia-Package] for
more information about where these files appear in a package.

## runtime

The runtime file specifies if execution of the application in the package
should be delegated to another process.

The runtime file is a JSON object with the following schema:

```
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "runner": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "required": [ "runner" ]
    }
}
```

The `runner` property names another application (or a package that contains
one) to which execution is to be delegated. The target application must expose
the [`ApplicationRunner`](../../services/application_runner.fidl) service.

## sandbox

The sandbox file controls the environment in which the contents of the package
execute. Specifically, the file controls which resources the package can access
during execution.

The sandbox file is a JSON object with the following schema:

```
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "dev": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "type": "string"
            }
        },
        "system": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "type": "string"
            }
        },
        "features": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "type": "string"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The `dev` array contains a list of well-known device paths that are provided to
the application. For example, if the string `class/input` appears in the `dev`
array, then `/dev/class/input` will appear in the namespaces of applications
loaded from the package.

The `system` array contains a list of well-known paths within the system package
that are provided to the application. For example, if the string `bin` appears
in the `system` array, then `/system/bin` will appear in the namespaces of
applications loaded from the package.

The `features` array contains a list of well-known features that the package
wishes to use. Including a feature in this list is a request for the environment
in which the contents of the package execute to be given the resources required
to use that feature.

The set of currently known features are as follows:

- `persistent-storage`, which requests access to persistent storage for the
  device, located in `/data` in the package's namespace. (Future work will
  likely make this access more fine-grained than just the `/data` directory.)

- `root-ssl-certificates`, which requests access to the root SSL certificates
  for the device. These certicates are provided in the `/etc/ssl` and
  `/system/data/boringssl` directories in the package's namespace. (The latter
  of which will be removed once all clients transition to the former.)

- `shell`, which grants access to the resources appropriate for an interactive
  command line. Typically, shells are granted access to all the resources
  available in the current environment.

- `vulkan`, which requests access to the resources required to use the Vulkan
  graphics interface.
