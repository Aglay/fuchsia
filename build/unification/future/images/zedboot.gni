# The contents of the zedboot ZBI.
# This ZBI has traditionally been put together by taking whatever was supposed
# to be in the fuchsia ZBI and retaining a subset of the files in bin/.
# Here we take a different (and more logical) approach which consists of listing
# the objects that we want in that ZBI. If multiple ZBI's need a common
# denominator, it needs to be factored out to a proper GN variable.
