# Generates a manifest for a given target recently migrated from the ZN build.

# The output of this action is a manifest file that replaces the one supplied
# by the ZN build for the given target. This makes it so that the target can be
# moved from one build to the other without having to worry about the impact on
# system assembly.
#
# Parameters
#
#   deps (required)
#     [list of labels] The targets to generate a manifest for.
#
#   testonly (optional)
#     Same as for any GN target.
