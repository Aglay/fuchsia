# This scope makes it easy to incorporate the Vulkan validation layers into a
# package. To use it, import this gni file and add the entries of the
# 'vulkan_validation_layers' scope to the package's 'loadable_modules',
# 'resources', and 'public_deps' parameters.
#
# Example BUILD.gn file:
#
# import("//third_party/vulkan_loader_and_validation_layers/layers/layers.gni")
#
# package("my_funky_vulkan_using_program") {
#   loadable_modules = [
#     ...
#     ] + vulkan_validation_layers.loadable_modules
#
#   resources = [
#     ...
#     ] + vulkan_validation_layers.resources
#
#   public_deps = [
#     ...
#     ] + vulkan_validation_layers.public_deps
# }
#
# This will end up placing the validation libraries within the package's "lib/"
# directory, where they can be loaded like normal libraries, and place the layer
# configuration data in the package's "data/vulkan/explicit_layer.d" directory which
# is mapped to "/config/vulkan/explicit_layer.d"
