# Defines a Rust procedural macro
#
# Parameters
#
#   name
#     Name of the crate as defined in its manifest file. If not specified, it is
#     assumed to be the same as the target name.
#
#   version (optional)
#     Semver version of the crate as seen on crates.io.
#
#   edition
#     Edition of the Rust language to be used.
#     Options are "2015" and "2018". If unsure, choose "2018".
#
#   configs (optional)
#     A list of config labels applying to this target.
#
#   deps (optional)
#     List of rust_library GN targets on which this crate depends.
#     Third party crates can be included through paths like
#     "//third_party/rust_crates:<cratename>".
#
#   source_root (optional)
#     Location of the crate root (e.g. `src/main.rs` or `src/lib.rs`).
#     This defaults to `./src/main.rs` for binaries and `./src/lib.rs` for libraries,
#     and should only be changed when absolutely necessary
#     (such as in the case of generated code).
#
# Example of usage:
#
#   rustc_macro("foo") {
#     deps = [
#       "//garnet/public/rust/bar",
#       "//third_party/rust_crates:serde",
#       "//third_party/rust_crates:slab",
#     ]
#   }

  # Compiling procedural macros is... a bit awkward.

  # Even though they're provided to crates that use them as if they were normal
  # external crates, they're actually '.so'/'.dylib's that are compiled for the host machine
  # and then linked into the compiler, so they and all their dependencies should
  # be built for the host target.
  #
  # Once this is done, the resulting artifacts are copied into the Fuchsia target
  # directories to act as if they had been built for Fuchsia. In order to avoid
  # conflicts, the outputs of the original (host) artifact are built with a
  # `_proc_macro` suffix added onto the end, which is removed when they're copied
  # into the final target directory.
