# The code needs to be compiled separately for production and test use for two
# reasons.
#
# The first reason only affects the flag-parsing code (src/flags.cpp): it uses
# the `__scudo_default_options` callback function.  The test code wants to
# define this to set special options needed by certain tests.  But defining it
# by that name will also affect the production Scudo built into libc, which the
# test should not do (and it makes it very hard to e.g. debug the test linked
# against a libc containing a slightly different version of Scudo than the code
# under test).  So both the flag-parsing code and the test code must be
# compiled with `-D__scudo_default_options=<some other name>` to make the test
# code safe.
#
# TODO(fxbug.dev/64175): The second reason is similar but more subtle and it
# affects much of the code, both the Scudo code proper and the gwp_asan code it
# incorporates.  These both use thread-local state that is directly located in
# the thread structure when the code is built into libc, because normal
# `thread_local` C++ variables are not available inside libc itself (due to
# implementation constraints in the dynamic linker).  If the test code is built
# the same way, then it will clobber the thread-local state of the libc
# Scudo/gwp_asan code, which the test should not do.
