# When a library needs to be built both by the Zircon and Fuchsia builds,
# its directory may contain a BUILD.gn and a BUILD.zircon.gn that are
# symlinked together. This ensures they stay in sync easily.
#
# Such build files will import "$zx_build/public/gn/migrated_targets.gni"
# to ensure that the definitions of zx_library(), zx_host_tool() and other
# templates and global variables are properly defined.
#
# This file is what is imported by the Zircon build. For the Fuchsia build,
# the corresponding file is in
# //build/unification/zn_build/public/gn/migrated_targets.gni

# The Zircon build already defines many templates and global variables
# by default. But host_tool_action() needs an import.
