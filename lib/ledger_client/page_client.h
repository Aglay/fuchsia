// A helper class that holds on to a page snapshot through a shared
// pointer, hands out shared pointers to it, can replace the snapshot
// by a new one, and registers a connection error handler on it. It
// essentially wraps ledger::PageSnapshot.
//
// This is used by classes that hold onto a PageSnapshot and update it
// in return calls from PageWatcher notifications, and use Operation
// containers to access the snapshot.
//
// Every time we receive an OnChange notification, we update the page
// snapshot so we see the current state. Just in case, we also install
// a connection error handler on the snapshot connection, so we can
// log when the connection unexpectedly closes, although we cannot do
// anything else about it.
//
// An instance of this class always holds the current snapshot of the
// page we read from, as obtained from the watcher on the page. It is
// held by a shared pointer, because the update may occur while
// Operation instances that read from it are still in progress, and
// they need to hold on to the same snapshot they started with, lest
// the methods called on that snapshot never return.
//
// The same behavior as with a shared_ptr could be accomplished with
// a duplicate PageSnapshotPtr for each Operation instance that needs
// one, but PageSnapshot doesn't have a duplicate method.
class PageClient : ledger::PageWatcher {
 public:
  // |context| is used as a string prefix on log messages.  |ledger_client| is
  // used to retrieve a handle to the page specified in |page_id|, and to
  // listen for conflicts from the ledger. If |prefix| is provided, the
  // resulting page snapshot and change notifications are limited to only keys
  // with that prefix. However, OnPageChange()'s |key| will include the full
  // key, including the prefix.

  // |ledger_client| must outlive *this.

  // snapshot might be replaced by a new one from an incoming page watcher
  // notification, but the client needs to hold onto the previous one until its
  // operation completes.
  //
  // CAVEAT. To use this snapshot does not make sense for most clients (in fact
  // it's no longer used in the modular code base). If the client implements
  // page write operations and page read operations, an invariant normally
  // maintained is that a read operation returns a value from *after* a
  // preceding write (which might be a different value than the one written when
  // there were merges from network sync), but never from *before* the preceding
  // write. This invariant is maintained when the read operation uses a fresh
  // snapshot, but not when the read operation uses the latest watcher snapshot
  // (because the watcher notification from the write might not yet have arrived
  // when the read is executed). Since all modular page clients have read and
  // write operations where this invariant is desired, they all use fresh page
  // snapshots.
