// A helper class that holds on to a page snapshot through a shared
// pointer, hands out shared pointers to it, can replace the snapshot
// by a new one, and registers a connection error handler on it. It
// essentially wraps fuchsia::ledger::PageSnapshot.
//
// This is used by classes that hold onto a PageSnapshot and update it
// in return calls from PageWatcher notifications, and use Operation
// containers to access the snapshot.
//
// Every time we receive an OnChange notification, we update the page
// snapshot so we see the current state. Just in case, we also install
// a connection error handler on the snapshot connection, so we can
// log when the connection unexpectedly closes, although we cannot do
// anything else about it.
//
// An instance of this class always holds the current snapshot of the
// page we read from, as obtained from the watcher on the page. It is
// held by a shared pointer, because the update may occur while
// Operation instances that read from it are still in progress, and
// they need to hold on to the same snapshot they started with, lest
// the methods called on that snapshot never return.
//
// The same behavior as with a shared_ptr could be accomplished with
// a duplicate PageSnapshotPtr for each Operation instance that needs
// one, but PageSnapshot doesn't have a duplicate method.
