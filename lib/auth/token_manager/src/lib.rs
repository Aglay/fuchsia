//! TokenManager manages a set of service provider credentials.

//! Supported credential types include long-lived OAuth refresh tokens and short-lived OAuth
//! access tokens and Firebase tokens derived from these. Long-lived tokens are stored in a
//! database and short-lived credentials are cached where possible.
//!
//! A client of the TokenManager must provide the path for the credential database and suppliers
//! for AuthProviders and AuthenticationUiContexts.
