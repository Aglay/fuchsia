### `gn clean` the FUCHSIA_BUILD_DIR

## If FUCHSIA_BUILD_DIR is out/x64, this is simply:
##   gn clean out/x64
## It is useful to clean the build directory without having to re-gen.

source "$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"/lib/vars.sh
fx-config-read

set -ex

"${FUCHSIA_DIR}/buildtools/gn" clean "$FUCHSIA_BUILD_DIR"

# Also clean zircon, it's not yet gn-ized, but we shouldn't care.
# "fx build-zircon -c" interprets "clean" as rm -rf $ZIRCON_BUILDROOT,
# so we do too.
rm -rf -- "$ZIRCON_BUILDROOT"
