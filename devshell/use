### Re-use a previous build directory set up by `fx set`.

## usage: fx use DIR
##
## Switches further `fx` commands to using a different build directory.
## This only works if `fx set ... --build-dir DIR` succeeded previously
## (and DIR has not been removed since).  The next `fx build` or other
## such command will now refer to DIR.  The previous build directory is
## left in place, so you can switch back again with `fx use` later.
