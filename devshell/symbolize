### symbolize backtraces and program locations provided as input on stdin

## This tool takes in log output from either zx_log or syslog and processes
## the results to make the symbolizer markup in them human readable.
## Anything that is not valid marked up is left alone. This is similar
## to how c++filt works for demangling C++ symbols.
