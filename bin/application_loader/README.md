# Network Application Loader

This app loader loads a VMO from a network URL for use with ApplicationRunner.
It is wired into the app loading process by Modular bootstrap. See
[//peridot/bin/bootstrap/loaders.config](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/modular/+/master/src/bootstrap/loaders.config)
for scheme mappings.
