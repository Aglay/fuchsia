  // DelayedStatus allows us to avoid merge storms (several devices battling
  // to merge branches but not agreeing). We use the following algorithm:
  // - Old (local or originally remote) changes are always merged right away.
  // Local changes do not pose any risk risk of storm, as you cannot storm with
  // yourself.
  // - When a remote change arrives, that is a merge of two merges, then we are
  // at risk of a merge storm. In that case, we delay.
  // - If we receive any new commit while we are delaying, these are not merged
  // right away; they are only merged after the delay.
  // - Once the delay is finished, we merge everything we know. Upload will not
  // happen until we finish merging all branches, so we don't risk amplifying a
  // storm while merging.
  // - If, after that, we still need to do a merge of a merge from remote
  // commits, then we delay again, but more (exponential backoff).
  // - We reset this backoff delay to its initial value once we see a non
  // merge-of-a-merge commit.
