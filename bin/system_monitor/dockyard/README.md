# System Monitor Dockyard

The Dockyard is used as a library (with no GUI itself) that collects data from
the Fuchsia device through the transport system. It responds to requests from
the GUI for digestible (i.e. small) sections of data that will be presented to
the user.

In the future, the Dockyard may execute as an independent process on the Host
machine.
