// In performing all of our audio analysis tests with a specific buffer length,
// we can choose input sinusoids with frequencies that perfectly fit within
// those buffers, eliminating the need for FFT windowing. Our measurement
// frequencies are specifically chosen as approximations of the standard "3
// freqs" per octave" representative set, assuming a 65536/48000 ratio between
// buffer size and eventual sample rate.
//
// Working in concert with GenerateCosine, these summary frequencies (currently
// 40 Hz, 1 kHz and 12 kHz) are "phase-locked" to the size of the buffer used in
// our frequency-based testing, in that the actual frequency is calculated so
// that there is an exact integral number of complete sinusoidal periods within
// the source data buffer. This eliminates the need for us to performing
// windowing or other data conditioning before performing frequency analysis,
// although it does make the actual values sent to GenerateCosine slightly
// different than the actual frequency.

// Furthermore, we adjust these values slightly so that their periods are not
// closely related geometrically to the sample rate -- we do this so that
// sampling of a given sinusoid will be more statistically spread across the
// entire waveform, rather than this happening at just a few spots (for example,
// using approximately 11997.8 Hz instead of 12000 Hz).
//
// For now we assume an eventual 48 kHz output sample rate, so (along with our
// source buffer of size 65536) this translation ratio is 65536/48000. In other
// words, the 'freq' value that we should send to GenerateCosine in order to
// simulate a 1 kHz sinusoid would be 1363.
