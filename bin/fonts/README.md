# Fonts

An app that provides font data to other apps.

## Provided fonts.
Currently, we provide the Roboto family of fonts.

We additionally provide the Material Design Fonts, which must be kept
in sync with Flutter's version of it. See
[here](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Updating-Material-Design-Fonts)
for their update instructions.
