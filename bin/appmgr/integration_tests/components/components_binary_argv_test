# This script runs:
#   run fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/components_binary_test#meta/program1.cmx
#   run fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/components_binary_test#meta/program2.cmx
# which are components that print their argv0 (or "$argv0 $argv1" if given an
# argv1), which happens to be the binary path within /pkg for ELF binary
# components.
#
# We therefore test that targeting a binary by a component manifest works, that
# argv0 properly propagates the binary path, and that the args field in the
# manifest is being properly passed through to the component.
