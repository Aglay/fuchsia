# Swarming is the task distribution system used by Fuchsia to run automated
# builds. A dimension is a formal Swarming concept effectively given by a
# key-value pair; it describes a bot property that can be targeted. Below are
# the published dimensions for the platforms we have available to test on.
# For more general Swarming documentation see
