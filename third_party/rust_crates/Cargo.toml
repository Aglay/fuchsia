# This file describes the third-party packages used by Rust code and how they should be built.
#
# Every edit to this file should be followed by `fx update-rustc-third-party`, a build,
# and then `fx update-rustc-crate-map --output third_party/rust_crates/crate_map.json`.
#
# Always request non-default features you use. This can sometimes get missed if
# another third-party crate in our build requests the same feature you use:
# your builds will usually work, but `fx rustdoc` will fail.
#
# More information is available in docs/development/languages/rust/third_party.md.
