# GN Build Arguments

## All builds

### active_partition

**Current value (from the default):** `""`

From //build/images/args.gni:70

### add_qemu_to_build_archives
Whether to include images necessary to run Fuchsia in QEMU in build
archives.

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //build/images/args.gni:77

### additional_bootserver_arguments
Additional bootserver args to add to pave.sh. New uses of this should be
added with caution, and ideally discussion. The present use case is to
enable throttling of netboot when specific network adapters are combined
with specific boards, due to driver and hardware challenges.

**Current value (from the default):** `""`

From //build/images/args.gni:83

### all_font_file_paths
List of file paths to every font asset. Populated in fonts.gni.

**Current value (from the default):** `[]`

Build boot images that prefer Zedboot over local boot (only for EFI).

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //build/images/args.gni:95

### asan_default_options
Default [AddressSanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html)
options (before the `ASAN_OPTIONS` environment variable is read at
runtime).  This can be set as a build argument to affect most "asan"
variants in `known_variants` (which see), or overridden in
toolchain_args in one of those variants.  Note that setting this
nonempty may conflict with programs that define their own
`__asan_default_options` C function.

**Current value (from the default):** `""`

From //build/config/sanitizers/BUILD.gn:16

From //BUILD.gn:72

### base_package_labels
If you add package labels to this variable, the packages will be included in
the 'base' package set, which represents the set of packages that are part
of an OTA. These pacakages are updated as an atomic unit during an OTA
process and are immutable and are a superset of the TCB (Trusted Computing
Base) for a product. These packages are never evicted by the system.

**Current value (from the default):** `""`

From //build/images/fvm.gni:45

### blobfs_maximum_bytes
In addition to reserving space for inodes and data, fs needs additional
space for maintaining some internal data structures. So the
space required to reserve inodes and data may exceed sum of the space
needed for inodes and data.
maximum_bytes puts an upper bound on the total bytes reserved for inodes,
data bytes and reservation for all other internal fs metadata.

From //build/images/fvm.gni:66

### blobfs_minimum_data_bytes
Number of bytes to reserve for data in the fs. This is in addition
to what is reserved, if any, for the inodes. Data bytes constitutes
"usable" space of the fs.
An empty string does not reserve any additional space than minimum
required for the filesystem.

**Current value (from the default):** `""`

From //build/images/fvm.gni:52

### blobfs_minimum_inodes
minimum_inodes is the number of inodes to reserve for the fs

### build_sdk_archives
Whether to build SDK tarballs.

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //build/sdk/config.gni:7

### cache_package_labels
If you add package labels to this variable, the packages will be included
in the 'cache' package set, which represents an additional set of software
that is made available on disk immediately after paving and in factory
flows. These packages are not updated with an OTA, but instead are updated
ephemerally. This cache of software can be evicted by the system if storage

### concurrent_dart_jobs
Maximum number of Dart processes to run in parallel.

Dart analyzer uses a lot of memory which may cause issues when building

Maximum number of Go processes to run in parallel.

**Current value (from the default):** `32`

From //build/go/BUILD.gn:11

### concurrent_link_jobs

linking is memory-intensive. The default to use varies by platform and by
the amount of memory available, so we call out to a script to get the right
value.

**Current value (from the default):** `32`

From //build/toolchain/BUILD.gn:15

### concurrent_rust_jobs
Maximum number of Rust processes to run in parallel.

code generation.

**Current value (from the default):** `"core"`

From //third_party/dart/runtime/runtime_args.gni:56

### dart_custom_version_for_pub
When this argument is a non-empty string, the version repoted by the
Dart VM will be one that is compatible with pub's interpretation of
semantic version strings. The version string will also include the values
of the argument. In particular the version string will read:

    "M.m.p-dev.x.x-$(dart_custom_version_for_pub)-$(short_git_hash)"

Where 'M', 'm', and 'p' are the major, minor and patch version numbers,
and 'dev.x.x' is the dev version tag most recently preceeding the current
revision. The short git hash can be omitted by setting
dart_version_git_info=false

**Current value (from the default):** `""`

From //third_party/dart/runtime/runtime_args.gni:73

### dart_debug
Instead of using is_debug, we introduce a different flag for specifying a
Debug build of Dart so that clients can still use a Release build of Dart
while themselves doing a Debug build.

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //third_party/dart/runtime/runtime_args.gni:9

### dart_debug_optimization_level
The optimization level to use for debug builds. Defaults to 0 for builds with
code coverage enabled.

**Current value (from the default):** `"2"`

From //third_party/dart/runtime/runtime_args.gni:36

### dart_default_app
Controls whether dart_app() targets generate JIT or AOT Dart snapshots.
This defaults to JIT, use `fx set <ARCH> --args
'dart_default_app="dart_aot_app"' to switch to AOT.

**Current value (from the default):** `"dart_jit_app"`

From [//topaz/runtime/dart/dart_component.gni:19](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/topaz/+/2d95004b8a583044372ccda5cb84e4fe3820c013/runtime/dart/dart_component.gni#19)

### dart_enable_wasm
Whether dart:wasm should be enabled.

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //third_party/dart/runtime/runtime_args.gni:94

### dart_force_product
Forces all Dart and Flutter apps to build in a specific configuration that
we use to build products.

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From [//topaz/runtime/dart/config.gni:10](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/topaz/+/2d95004b8a583044372ccda5cb84e4fe3820c013/runtime/dart/config.gni#10)

### dart_lib_export_symbols
Whether libdart should export the symbols of the Dart API.

**Current value (from the default):** `true`

From //third_party/dart/runtime/runtime_args.gni:91

### dart_platform_bytecode
Controls whether the VM uses bytecode.

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //third_party/dart/runtime/runtime_args.gni:84

### dart_runtime_mode
Set the runtime mode. This affects how the runtime is built and what
features it has. Valid values are:
'develop' (the default) - VM is built to run as a JIT with all development
features enabled.
'profile' - The VM is built to run with AOT compiled code with only the
CPU profiling features enabled.
'release' - The VM is built to run with AOT compiled code with no developer
features enabled.

These settings are only used for Flutter, at the moment. A standalone build
of the Dart VM should leave this set to "develop", and should set
'is_debug', 'is_release', or 'is_product'.

TODO(rmacnak): dart_runtime_mode no longer selects whether libdart is build
for JIT or AOT, since libdart waw split into libdart_jit and
libdart_precompiled_runtime. We should remove this flag and just set
dart_debug/dart_product.

### dart_use_tcmalloc
Whether to link the standalone VM against tcmalloc. The standalone build of
the VM enables this only for Linux builds.

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //third_party/dart/runtime/runtime_args.gni:47

### dart_version_git_info
Whether the Dart binary version string should include the git hash and
git commit time.

**Current value (from the default):** `true`

From //third_party/dart/runtime/runtime_args.gni:60

### dart_vm_code_coverage
Whether to enable code coverage for the standalone VM.

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //third_party/dart/runtime/runtime_args.gni:39

### data_partition_manifest
Path to manifest file containing data to place into the initial /data
partition.

**Current value (from the default):** `""`

### debian_guest_earlycon

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //src/virtualization/packages/debian_guest/BUILD.gn:10

### debian_guest_qcow
Package the rootfs as a QCOW image (as opposed to a flat file).

**Current value (from the default):** `true`

From //src/virtualization/packages/debian_guest/BUILD.gn:9

### debug_zircon_libraries_more
Use this flag to optimize source libraries imported from Zircon the same was
as other libraries in this build.
By default, they are optimized the same as in the ZN build, which leaves
less debugging information available.

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //build/unification/config/BUILD.gn:10

### default_git_folder
Absolute path to the .git folder.

This is used in rules that need to refer to `.git/logs/HEAD` to include
a hash in the version string. By default the folder is `.git`, but we define
it as an argument so it can be overriden by users of `git-worktree` (See
Issue #33619).

When using git-worktree, you can add

   default_git_folder = "/path/to/main/git/repo/.git/worktrees/name/"

to out/ReleaseX64/args.gn. The path above can be extracted from the `.git`
file under the git worktree folder.

**Current value (from the default):** `"//third_party/dart//.git"`

From //third_party/dart/sdk_args.gni:25

### devmgr_config
List of arguments to add to /boot/config/devmgr.
These come after synthesized arguments to configure blobfs and pkgfs.

**Current value (from the default):** `[]`

From //build/images/args.gni:18

### enable_api_diff
Detect dart API changes
TODO(fxb/36723, fxb/6623) Remove this flag once issues are resolved

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //build/dart/dart_library.gni:17

### enable_dart_analysis
Enable all dart analysis

**Current value (from the default):** `true`

From //build/dart/dart_library.gni:13

### enable_frame_pointers
Controls whether the compiler emits full stack frames for function calls.
This reduces performance but increases the ability to generate good
stack traces, especially when we have bugs around unwind table generation.
It applies only for Fuchsia targets (see below where it is unset).

TODO(ZX-2361): Theoretically unwind tables should be good enough so we can
remove this option when the issues are addressed.

**Current value (from the default):** `true`

### enable_gfx_subsystem

**Current value (from the default):** `true`

### enable_input_subsystem

**Current value (from the default):** `true`

From //src/ui/scenic/bin/BUILD.gn:12

### enable_mdns_trace
Enables the tracing feature of mdns, which can be turned on using
"mdns-util verbose".

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //src/connectivity/network/mdns/service/BUILD.gn:15

### enable_netboot
Whether to build the netboot zbi by default.

You can still build //build/images:netboot explicitly even if enable_netboot is false.

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //build/images/args.gni:58

### enable_user_pci

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //src/devices/bus/drivers/pci/pci.gni:6

### escher_test_for_glsl_spirv_mismatch
If true, this enables the |SpirvNotChangedTest| to check if the precompiled
shaders on disk are up to date and reflect the current shader source code
compiled with the latest shaderc tools/optimizations. People on the Scenic
team should build with this flag turned on to make sure that any shader
changes that were not run through the precompiler have their updated spirv
written to disk. Other teams and CQ do not need to worry about this flag.

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //src/ui/lib/escher/build_args.gni:26

### escher_use_null_vulkan_config_on_host
Using Vulkan on host (i.e. Linux) is an involved affair that involves
downloading the Vulkan SDK, setting environment variables, and so forth...
all things that are difficult to achieve in a CQ environment.  Therefore,
by default we use a stub implementation of Vulkan which fails to create a
VkInstance.  This allows everything to build, and also allows running Escher
unit tests which don't require Vulkan.

**Current value (from the default):** `true`

From //src/ui/lib/escher/build_args.gni:12

### escher_use_runtime_glsl
Determines whether or not escher will build with the glslang and shaderc
libraries. When false, these libraries will not be included in the scenic/
escher binary and as a result shaders will not be able to be compiled at
runtime. Precompiled spirv code will be loaded into memory from disk instead.

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //src/ui/lib/escher/build_args.gni:18

### exclude_kernel_service
Whether the VM includes the kernel service in all modes (debug, release,
product).

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //third_party/dart/runtime/runtime_args.gni:88

### expat_build_root

**Current value (from the default):** `"//third_party/expat"`

From //src/graphics/lib/magma/gnbuild/magma.gni:14

### experimental_wlan_client_mlme
Selects the SoftMAC client implementation to use. Choices:
  false (default) - C++ Client MLME implementation
  true - Rust Client MLME implementation
This argument is temporary until Rust MLME is ready to be used.

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //src/connectivity/wlan/lib/mlme/cpp/BUILD.gn:10

### extra_manifest_args
Extra args to globally apply to the manifest generation script.

**Current value (from the default):** `[]`

From //build/images/manifest.gni:21

### extra_package_labels

**Current value (from the default):** `[]`

From //third_party/cobalt/BUILD.gn:9

### extra_variants
Additional variant toolchain configs to support.
This is just added to [`known_variants`](#known_variants).

**Current value (from the default):** `[]`

From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:655

### fastboot_product

**Current value (from the default):** `""`

From //build/images/args.gni:72

### fidl_write_v1_wireformat
TODO(fxb/41298): This is a temporary change to activate writing the
v1 FIDL wire-format selectively. Remove this when all bindings start
writing v1 wire-format by default.

**Current value (from the default):** `true`

From //build/fidl/wireformat.gni:9

### filter_out_of_astro
Use this flag to exclude artifacts from Astro builds.
This is a very hacky way of ensuring that the resulting fuchsia.zbi fits
within the available space on device.
This will soon enough be replaced with a proper way to select image
artifacts based on board / product properties.
Artifacts that are known to not be useful on Astro builds (e.g. drivers for
other devices, tests) may be put in `if (!filter_out_of_astro)` blocks.
TODO(45680): remove this hack.

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //build/unification/images/BUILD.gn:14

### flutter_default_app

**Current value (from the default):** `"flutter_jit_app"`

From [//topaz/runtime/dart/dart_component.gni:12](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/topaz/+/2d95004b8a583044372ccda5cb84e4fe3820c013/runtime/dart/dart_component.gni#12)

### flutter_driver_enabled
Enables/Disables flutter driver using '--args=flutter_driver_enabled=[true/false]'
in fx set. (Disabled by default)
This is effective only on debug builds.

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //build/testing/flutter_driver.gni:9

### flutter_profile

**Current value (from the default):** `true`

From [//topaz/runtime/dart/dart_component.gni:26](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/topaz/+/2d95004b8a583044372ccda5cb84e4fe3820c013/runtime/dart/dart_component.gni#26)

### flutter_space_dart
Whether experimental space dart mode is enabled for Flutter applications.

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From [//topaz/runtime/dart/dart_component.gni:32](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/topaz/+/2d95004b8a583044372ccda5cb84e4fe3820c013/runtime/dart/dart_component.gni#32)

### font_catalog_paths

**Current value (from the default):** `["//prebuilt/third_party/fonts/fuchsia.font_catalog.json"]`

From //src/fonts/build/font_args.gni:17

### font_pkg_entries
Merged contents of .font_pkgs.json files. Populated in fonts.gni.

**Current value (from the default):** `[]`

From //src/fonts/build/font_args.gni:32

### font_pkgs_paths
Locations of .font_pkgs.json files, which list the locations of font files
within the workspace, as well as safe names that are derived from the fonts'
file names and can be used to name Fuchsia packages.

**Current value (from the default):** `["//prebuilt/third_party/fonts/fuchsia.font_pkgs.json"]`

From //src/fonts/build/font_args.gni:22

### fonts_dir
Directory into which all fonts are checked out from CIPD

**Current value (from the default):** `"//prebuilt/third_party/fonts"`

From //src/fonts/build/font_args.gni:12

### fuchsia_sdk_root
Consumers of the Fuchsia SDK instantiate templates for various SDK parts at
a specific spot within their buildroots. The target name for the specific
part is then derived from the part name as specified in the meta.json
manifest. Different buildroot instantiate the SDK parts at different
locations and then set this variable. GN rules can then prefix this variable
name in SDK builds to the name of the SDK part. This flag is meaningless in
non-SDK buildroots.

**Current value (from the default):** `""`

From //build/fuchsia/sdk.gni:17

### fuchsia_ta_uuids
UUID of TAs to include in the Fuchsia build.

**Current value (from the default):** `[]`

From //build/images/ta.gni:10

### fvm_image_size
The size in bytes of the FVM partition image to create. Normally this is
computed to be just large enough to fit the blob and data images. The
default value is "", which means to size based on inputs. Specifying a size
that is too small will result in build failure.

**Current value (from the default):** `""`

From //build/images/fvm.gni:12

### fvm_max_disk_size
The max size of the disk where the FVM is written. This is used for
preallocating metadata to determine how much the FVM can expand on disk.
Only applies to sparse FVM images. At sparse image construction time, the
build fails if the inputs are larger than `fvm_max_disk_size`. At paving
time, the FVM will be sized to the target's disk size up to
`fvm_max_disk_size`. If the size of the disk increases after initial paving,
the FVM will resize up to `fvm_max_disk_size`. During paving, if the target
FVM has declared a smaller size than `fvm_max_disk_size`, the FVM is
reinitialized to the larger size.
The default value is "" which sets the max disk size to the size of the disk
at pave/format time.

**Current value (from the default):** `""`

From //build/images/fvm.gni:25

### fvm_slice_size
The size of the FVM partition images "slice size". The FVM slice size is a
minimum size of a particular chunk of a partition that is stored within
FVM. A very small slice size may lead to decreased throughput. A very large
slice size may lead to wasted space. The selected default size of 8mb is
selected for conservation of space, rather than performance.

**Current value (from the default):** `"8388608"`

From //build/images/fvm.gni:32

### glm_build_root

**Current value (from the default):** `"//third_party/glm"`

From //src/graphics/lib/magma/gnbuild/magma.gni:17

### go_vet_enabled
  go_vet_enabled
    [bool] if false, go vet invocations are disabled for all builds.

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //build/go/go_build.gni:21

### gocache_dir
  gocache_dir
    Directory GOCACHE environment variable will be set to. This directory
    will have build and test results cached, and is safe to be written to
    concurrently. If overridden, this directory must be a full path.

**Current value (from the default):** `"/b/s/w/ir/k/root_build_dir/fidling/.gocache"`

From //build/go/go_build.gni:17

### goma_dir
Directory containing the Goma source code.  This can be a GN
source-absolute path ("//...") or a system absolute path.

**Current value (from the default):** `"//prebuilt/third_party/goma/linux-x64"`

From //build/toolchain/goma.gni:15

### graphics_compute_generate_debug_shaders
Set to true in your args.gn file to generate pre-processed and
auto-formatted shaders under the "debug" sub-directory of HotSort
and Spinel target generation output directories.

These are never used, but can be reviewed manually to verify the
impact of configuration parameters, or when modifying a compute
shader.

Example results:

  out/default/
    gen/src/graphics/lib/compute/
       hotsort/targets/hs_amd_gcn3_u64/
          comp/
            hs_transpose.comp -> unpreprocessed shader
          debug/
            hs_transpose.glsl -> preprocessed shader


**Current value (from the default):** `true`

From //src/graphics/lib/compute/gn/glsl_shader_rules.gni:28

### graphics_compute_skip_spirv_opt
At times we may want to compare the performance of unoptimized
vs. optimized shaders.  On desktop platforms, use of spirv-opt
doesn't appear to provide major performance improvements but it
significantly reduces the size of the SPIR-V modules.

Disabling the spirv-opt pass may also be useful in identifying and
attributing code generation bugs.


**Current value (from the default):** `true`

From //src/graphics/lib/compute/gn/glsl_shader_rules.gni:38

### graphics_compute_verbose_compile
The glslangValidator compiler is noisy by default.  A cleanly
compiling shader still prints out its filename.

This negatively impacts the GN build.

For this reason, we silence the compiler with the "-s" option but
unfortunately this also disables all error reporting.

Set to true to see detailed error reporting.


**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //src/graphics/lib/compute/gn/glsl_shader_rules.gni:50

### host_byteorder

**Current value (from the default):** `"undefined"`

From //build/config/host_byteorder.gni:7

### host_cpu

**Current value (from the default):** `"x64"`

### host_os

**Current value (from the default):** `"linux"`

### host_tools_dir
This is the directory where host tools intended for manual use by
developers get installed.  It's something a developer might put
into their shell's $PATH.  Host tools that are just needed as part
of the build do not get copied here.  This directory is only for
things that are generally useful for testing or debugging or
whatnot outside of the GN build itself.  These are only installed
by an explicit install_host_tools() rule (see //build/host.gni).

**Current value (from the default):** `"//root_build_dir/host-tools"`

From //build/host.gni:13

### icu_use_data_file
Tells icu to load an external data file rather than rely on the icudata
being linked directly into the binary.

**Current value (from the default):** `true`

From [//third_party/icu/config.gni:8](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/third_party/icu/+/995c0373ab900da6cbf97cb3074d9f475efaa915/config.gni#8)

### include_devmgr_config_in_vbmeta
If true, /config/devmgr config will be included into a vbmeta image
instead of bootfs.

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //build/images/vbmeta.gni:14

### include_internal_fonts
Set to true to include internal fonts in the build.

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //src/fonts/build/font_args.gni:7

### include_tests_that_fail_on_nuc_asan
Whether to include tests that are known to fail on NUC with ASan.
Should be set to false in the infra builders that have board == "x64" and
"asan" in variants.

**Current value (from the default):** `true`

From //build/testing/environments.gni:11

### include_zxdb_large_tests
Normally these tests are not built and run because they require large amounts of optional data
be downloaded. Set this to true to enable the build for the zxdb_large_tests.
See symbols/test_data/README.md for how to download the data required for this test.

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //src/developer/debug/zxdb/BUILD.gn:13

### inet_config_enable_async_dns_sockets

### is_debug
Debug build.

**Current value (from the default):** `true`

From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:25

### kernel_cmdline_args
List of kernel command line arguments to bake into the boot image.
See also [kernel_cmdline](/docs/reference/kernel/kernel_cmdline.md) and
[`devmgr_config`](#devmgr_config).

**Current value for `target_cpu = "arm64"`:** `["kernel.enable-debugging-syscalls=true", "kernel.enable-serial-syscalls=true", "netsvc.all-features=true", "netsvc.disable=false", "console.shell=true", "kernel.oom.behavior=reboot"]`

From //products/core.gni:14

**Overridden from the default:** `[]`

From //products/core.gni:14

**Overridden from the default:** `[]`

From //build/images/args.gni:23

### kernel_cmdline_files
Files containing additional kernel command line arguments to bake into
the boot image.  The contents of these files (in order) come after any
arguments directly in [`kernel_cmdline_args`](#kernel_cmdline_args).
These can be GN `//` source pathnames or absolute system pathnames.

**Current value (from the default):** `[]`

From //build/images/args.gni:29

### known_variants
List of variants that will form the basis for variant toolchains.
To make use of a variant, set [`select_variant`](#select_variant).

Normally this is not set as a build argument, but it serves to
document the available set of variants.
See also [`universal_variants`](#universal_variants).
Only set this to remove all the default variants here.
To add more, set [`extra_variants`](#extra_variants) instead.

Each element of the list is one variant, which is a scope defining:

  `configs` (optional)
      [list of labels] Each label names a config that will be
      automatically used by every target built in this variant.
      For each config `${label}`, there must also be a target
      `${label}_deps`, which each target built in this variant will
      automatically depend on.  The `variant()` template is the
      recommended way to define a config and its `_deps` target at
      the same time.

  `remove_common_configs` (optional)
  `remove_shared_configs` (optional)
      [list of labels] This list will be removed (with `-=`) from
      the `default_common_binary_configs` list (or the
      `default_shared_library_configs` list, respectively) after
      all other defaults (and this variant's configs) have been
      added.

  `deps` (optional)
      [list of labels] Added to the deps of every target linked in
      this variant (as well as the automatic `${label}_deps` for
      each label in configs).

  `name` (required if configs is omitted)
      [string] Name of the variant as used in
      [`select_variant`](#select_variant) elements' `variant` fields.
      It's a good idea to make it something concise and meaningful when
      seen as e.g. part of a directory name under `$root_build_dir`.
      If name is omitted, configs must be nonempty and the simple names
      (not the full label, just the part after all `/`s and `:`s) of these
      configs will be used in toolchain names (each prefixed by a "-"),
      so the list of config names forming each variant must be unique
      among the lists in `known_variants + extra_variants`.

  `toolchain_args` (optional)
      [scope] Each variable defined in this scope overrides a
      build argument in the toolchain context of this variant.

  `host_only` (optional)
  `target_only` (optional)
      [scope] This scope can contain any of the fields above.
      These values are used only for host or target, respectively.
      Any fields included here should not also be in the outer scope.

From //src/graphics/drivers/msd-arm-mali/src/BUILD.gn:13

### msd_arm_enable_protected_debug_swap_mode
In protected mode, faults don't return as much information so they're much harder to debug. To
work around that, add a mode where protected atoms are executed in non-protected mode and
vice-versa.

NOTE: The memory security ranges should also be set (in TrustZone) to the opposite of normal, so
that non-protected mode accesses can only access protected memory and vice versa.  Also,
growable memory faults won't work in this mode, so larger portions of growable memory should
precommitted (which is not done by default).

### select_variant
List of "selectors" to request variant builds of certain targets.
Each selector specifies matching criteria and a chosen variant.
The first selector in the list to match a given target determines
which variant is used for that target.

Each selector is either a string or a scope.  A shortcut selector is
a string; it gets expanded to a full selector.  A full selector is a
scope, described below.

A string selector can match a name in
[`select_variant_shortcuts`](#select_variant_shortcuts).  If it's not a
specific shortcut listed there, then it can be the name of any variant
described in [`known_variants`](#known_variants) and
[`universal_variants`](#universal_variants) (and combinations thereof).
A `selector` that's a simple variant name selects for every binary
built in the target toolchain: `{ host=false variant=selector }`.

If a string selector contains a slash, then it's `"shortcut/filename"`
and selects only the binary in the target toolchain whose `output_name`
matches `"filename"`, i.e. it adds `output_name=["filename"]` to each
selector scope that the shortcut's name alone would yield.

The scope that forms a full selector defines some of these:

    variant (required)
        [string or `false`] The variant that applies if this selector
        matches.  This can be `false` to choose no variant, or a string
        that names the variant.  See
        [`known_variants`](#known_variants) and
        [`universal_variants`](#universal_variants).

The rest below are matching criteria.  All are optional.
The selector matches if and only if all of its criteria match.
If none of these is defined, then the selector always matches.

The first selector in the list to match wins and then the rest of
the list is ignored.  To construct more complex rules, use a blocklist
selector with `variant=false` before a catch-all default variant, or
a list of specific variants before a catch-all false variant.

Each "[strings]" criterion is a list of strings, and the criterion
is satisfied if any of the strings matches against the candidate string.

    host
        [boolean] If true, the selector matches in the host toolchain.
        If false, the selector matches in the target toolchain.

    testonly
        [boolean] If true, the selector matches targets with testonly=true.
        If false, the selector matches in targets without testonly=true.

    target_type
        [strings]: `"executable"`, `"loadable_module"`, or `"driver_module"`

    output_name
        [strings]: target's `output_name` (default: its `target name`)

    label
        [strings]: target's full label with `:` (without toolchain suffix)

    name
        [strings]: target's simple name (label after last `/` or `:`)

    dir
        [strings]: target's label directory (`//dir` for `//dir:name`).

**Current value (from the default):** `[]`

From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:860

### select_variant_canonical
*This should never be set as a build argument.*
It exists only to be set in `toolchain_args`.
See //build/toolchain/clang_toolchain.gni for details.

**Current value (from the default):** `[]`

From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:865

### select_variant_shortcuts
List of short names for commonly-used variant selectors.  Normally this
is not set as a build argument, but it serves to document the available
set of short-cut names for variant selectors.  Each element of this list
is a scope where `.name` is the short name and `.select_variant` is a
a list that can be spliced into [`select_variant`](#select_variant).

**Current value (from the default):**
```
[{
  name = "host_asan"
  select_variant = [{
  dir = ["//third_party/yasm", "//third_party/vboot_reference", "//tools/vboot_reference", "//src/fonts/font_info"]
  host = true

### signed_image

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //build/images/args.gni:71

### size_checker_input
The input to the size checker.
The build system will produce a JSON file to be consumed by the size checker, which
will check and prevent integration of subsystems that are over their space allocation.
The input consists of the following keys:

asset_ext(string array): a list of extensions that should be considered as assets.

asset_limit(number): maximum size (in bytes) allocated for the assets.

core_limit(number): maximum size (in bytes) allocated for the core system and/or services.
This is sort of a "catch all" component that consists of all the area / packages that weren't
specified in the components list below.

components(object array): a list of component objects. Each object should contain the following keys:

  component(string): name of the component.

  src(string array): path of the area / package to be included as part of the component.
  The path should be relative to the build directory.
  The target may also be a directory, in which case all blobs under that directory will be taken
  into account.

  limit(number): maximum size (in bytes) allocated for the component.

Example:
size_checker_input = {
  asset_ext = [ ".ttf" ]
  asset_limit = 10240
  core_limit = 10240
  components = [
    {
      component = "Foo"
      src = [ "obj/topaz/runtime/foo_runner" ]
      limit = 10240
    },
    {
      component = "Bar"
      src = [ "obj/build/images" ]
      limit = 20480
    },
  ]
}

**Current value (from the default):** `{ }`

### symbol_level
How many symbols to include in the build. This affects the performance of
the build since the symbols are large and dealing with them is slow.
  2 means regular build with symbols.

### toolchain_variant
*This should never be set as a build argument.*
It exists only to be set in `toolchain_args`.
See //build/toolchain/clang_toolchain.gni for details.
This variable is a scope giving details about the current toolchain:
    `toolchain_variant.base`
        [label] The "base" toolchain for this variant, *often the
        right thing to use in comparisons, not `current_toolchain`.*
        This is the toolchain actually referenced directly in GN
        source code.  If the current toolchain is not
        `shlib_toolchain` or a variant toolchain, this is the same
        as `current_toolchain`.  In one of those derivative
        toolchains, this is the toolchain the GN code probably
        thought it was in.  This is the right thing to use in a test
        like `toolchain_variant.base == target_toolchain`, rather
        rather than comparing against `current_toolchain`.
    `toolchain_variant.name`
        [string] The name of this variant, as used in `variant` fields
        in [`select_variant`](#select_variant) clauses.  In the base
        toolchain and its `shlib_toolchain`, this is `""`.
    `toolchain_variant.suffix`
        [string] This is "-${toolchain_variant.name}", "" if name is empty.
    `toolchain_variant.is_pic_default`
        [bool] This is true in `shlib_toolchain`.
The other fields are the variant's effects as defined in
[`known_variants`](#known_variants).

**Current value (from the default):**
```
{
  base = "//build/toolchain/fuchsia:arm64"
}
```

From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:99

### ubsan_default_options
Default [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html)
options (before the `UBSAN_OPTIONS` environment variable is read at
runtime).  This can be set as a build argument to affect most "ubsan"
variants in `known_variants` (which see), or overridden in
toolchain_args in one of those variants.  Note that setting this
nonempty may conflict with programs that define their own
`__ubsan_default_options` C function.

**Current value (from the default):** `"print_stacktrace=1:halt_on_error=1"`

From //build/config/sanitizers/BUILD.gn:30

### universal_variants

### universe_package_labels
If you add package labels to this variable, the packages will be included
in the 'universe' package set, which represents all software that is
produced that is to be published to a package repository or to the SDK by
the build. The build system ensures that the universe package set includes
the base and cache package sets, which means you do not need to redundantly
include those labels in this variable.

### unpack_debug_archives
To ensure that everything can be built without debug symbols present we
gate weather or not these are consumed on a build argument. When set,
unpack_debug_archives creates an additional build step that unpacks
debug archives in tar.bzip2 format into the .build-id directory

If no list is provided, all built kernels are included. The names in the
list are strings that must match the filename to be included in the update
package.

**Current value (from the default):** `[]`

From //build/images/args.gni:41

### use_cast_runner_canary

otherwise the most recently validated version is used.

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //src/cast/BUILD.gn:11

### use_ccache
Set to true to enable compiling with ccache

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //build/toolchain/ccache.gni:9

If $clang_tool_dir is "", then this controls how the Clang toolchain
binaries are found.  If true, then the standard prebuilt is used.
Otherwise the tools are just expected to be found by the shell via `PATH`.

**Current value (from the default):** `true`

From //zircon/public/gn/toolchain/clang.gni:11

### use_prebuilt_dart_sdk
Whether to use the prebuilt Dart SDK for everything.
When setting this to false, the preubilt Dart SDK will not be used in
situations where the version of the SDK matters, but may still be used as an
optimization where the version does not matter.

**Current value (from the default):** `true`

From //build/dart/dart.gni:15

### use_prebuilt_ffmpeg
Use a prebuilt ffmpeg binary rather than building it locally.  See
//src/media/lib/ffmpeg/README.md for details.  This is ignored when
building in variant builds for which there is no prebuilt.  In that
case, ffmpeg is always built from source so as to be built with the
selected variant's config.  When this is false (either explicitly or in
a variant build) then //third_party/ffmpeg must be in the source tree,
which requires:
`jiri import -name integration third_party/ffmpeg https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/integration`

**Current value (from the default):** `true`

From //src/media/lib/ffmpeg/BUILD.gn:14

### weave_system_config_use_sockets
Tells openweave components to use bsd-like sockets.

**Current value (from the default):** `true`

From [//third_party/openweave-core/config.gni:7](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/third_party/openweave-core/+/0adb7094201a0a20a6c2ac5ab9816ff7e5fb5fd7/config.gni#7)

Selects the wlan configuration type to use. Choices:
  "client" - client mode
  "ap" - access point mode
  "" (empty string) - no configuration

**Current value (from the default):** `"client"`

From //src/connectivity/wlan/wlancfg/BUILD.gn:16

### zbi_compression
Compression setting for ZBI "storage" items.
This can be either "lz4f" or "zstd", optionally followed by ".LEVEL"
where `LEVEL` can be an integer or "max".

**Current value (from the default):** `"zstd"`

From //build/config/fuchsia/zbi.gni:11

### zedboot_cmdline_args
List of kernel command line arguments to bake into the Zedboot image.
See //docs/reference/kernel_cmdline.md and
[`zedboot_devmgr_config`](#zedboot_devmgr_config).

**Current value (from the default):** `[]`

From //build/images/zedboot/zedboot_args.gni:9

### zedboot_cmdline_files
Files containing additional kernel command line arguments to bake into
the Zedboot image.  The contents of these files (in order) come after any
arguments directly in [`zedboot_cmdline_args`](#zedboot_cmdline_args).
These can be GN `//` source pathnames or absolute system pathnames.

**Current value (from the default):** `[]`

From //build/images/zedboot/zedboot_args.gni:15

### zedboot_devmgr_config

From //build/images/ta.gni:13

### zircon_a_partition
arguments to fx flash script

**Current value (from the default):** `""`

From //build/images/args.gni:64

### zircon_args
[Zircon GN build arguments](/docs/gen/zircon_build_arguments.md).
The default passes through GOMA/ccache settings and
[`select_variant`](#select_variant) shorthand selectors.
**Only set this if you want to wipe out all the defaults that
propagate from Fuchsia GN to Zircon GN.**  The default value
folds in [`zircon_extra_args`](#zircon_extra_args), so usually
it's better to just set `zircon_extra_args` and leave `zircon_args` alone.
Any individual Zircon build argument set in `zircon_extra_args` will
silently clobber the default value shown here.

**Current value (from the default):**
```
{
  default_deps = ["//:legacy-arm64", "//:legacy_host_targets-linux-x64", "//:legacy_unification-arm64", "//tools:all-hosts"]
  goma_dir = "/b/s/w/ir/k/prebuilt/third_party/goma/linux-x64"
  use_ccache = false
  use_goma = false
  variants = []
  zbi_compression = "zstd"
}
```

From //BUILD.gn:93

### zircon_asserts

**Current value (from the default):** `true`

From //build/config/fuchsia/BUILD.gn:219

### zircon_b_partition

**Current value (from the default):** `""`

From //build/images/args.gni:65

### zircon_build_root

**Current value (from the default):** `"//zircon"`

From //src/graphics/lib/magma/gnbuild/magma.gni:18

### zircon_compdb_filter
Compilation database filter. Gets passed to --export-compile-commands=<filter>.

**Current value (from the default):** `"legacy-arm64"`

From //BUILD.gn:67

### zircon_extra_args
[Zircon GN build arguments](/docs/gen/zircon_build_arguments.md).
This is included in the default value of [`zircon_args`](#zircon_args) so
you can set this to add things there without wiping out the defaults.
When you set `zircon_args` directly, then this has no effect at all.
Arguments you set here override any arguments in the default
`zircon_args`.  There is no way to append to a value from the defaults.
Note that for just setting simple (string-only) values in Zircon GN's
[`variants`](/docs/gen/zircon_build_arguments.md#variants), the
default [`zircon_args`](#zircon_args) uses a `variants` value derived from
[`select_variant`](#select_variant) so for simple cases there is no need
to explicitly set Zircon's `variants` here.

**Current value (from the default):** `{ }`

From //BUILD.gn:56

### zircon_extra_deps
Additional Zircon GN labels to include in the Zircon build.

**Current value (from the default):** `[]`

From //BUILD.gn:60

### zircon_r_partition

**Current value (from the default):** `""`

From //build/images/args.gni:66

### zircon_tracelog
Where to emit a tracelog from Zircon's GN run. No trace will be produced if
given the empty string. Path can be source-absolute or system-absolute.

**Current value (from the default):** `""`

From //BUILD.gn:64

### zvb_partition_name
Partition name from where image will be verified

**Current value (from the default):** `"zircon"`

From //build/images/vbmeta.gni:32

### zxcrypt_key_source
This argument specifies from where the system should obtain the zxcrypt
master key to the system data partition.

This value be reified as /boot/config/zxcrypt in both the zircon boot image
and the zedboot boot image, for consumption by fshost and the paver,
respectively.

Acceptable values are:
* "null": the device should use an all-0's master key, as we lack support
for any secure on-device storage.
* "tee": the device is required to have a Trusted Execution Environment
(TEE) which includes the "keysafe" Trusted Application (associated with the
KMS service).  The zxcrypt master key should be derived from a per-device
key accessible only to trusted apps running in the TEE.
* "tee-opportunistic": the device will attempt to use keys from the TEE if
available, but will fall back to using the null key if the key from the TEE
does not work, or if the TEE is not functional on this device.
* "tee-transitional": the device will require the use of a key from the TEE
for new volume creation, but will continue to try both a TEE-sourced key and
the null key when unsealing volumes.

In the future, we may consider adding support for TPMs, or additional logic
to explicitly support other fallback behavior.

**Current value (from the default):** `"null"`

From //build/images/zxcrypt.gni:29

## `target_cpu = "arm64"`

### amlogic_decoder_firmware_path
Path to the amlogic decoder firmware file. Overrides the default in the build.

**Current value (from the default):** `""`

From //src/media/drivers/amlogic_decoder/BUILD.gn:12

### arm_float_abi
The ARM floating point mode. This is either the string "hard", "soft", or
"softfp". An empty string means to use the default one for the
arm_version.

**Current value (from the default):** `""`

From //build/config/arm.gni:20

### arm_optionally_use_neon
Whether to enable optional NEON code paths.

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //build/config/arm.gni:31

### arm_tune
The ARM variant-specific tuning mode. This will be a string like "armv6"
or "cortex-a15". An empty string means to use the default for the
arm_version.

**Current value (from the default):** `""`

From //build/config/arm.gni:25

### arm_use_neon
Whether to use the neon FPU instruction set or not.

**Current value (from the default):** `true`

From //build/config/arm.gni:28

### arm_version

### platform_enable_user_pci
Setting this config to true only makes sense if the zircon enable_user_pci config is also true.
We define a separate config here for the moment due to not quite unified builds and the
difficulty of sharing configs between builds.

**Current value (from the default):** `false`

From //zircon/system/dev/board/x86/BUILD.gn:25
