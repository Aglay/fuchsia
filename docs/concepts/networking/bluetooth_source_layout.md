# Bluetooth Source Layout

The [Bluetooth System](/docs/concepts/networking/bluetooth_architecture.md)
comprises many components, such as drivers, profiles, and client
applications. This document provides an overview of where the various components
live in the source tree.

See the [HCI section of the Bluetooth System document](/docs/concepts/networking/bluetooth_architecture.md#hci) for an explanation of how the drivers, such as `bt-transport`, `bt-hci`, and `bt-host`, relate to each other.

See the [Host Bus section of the Bluetooth System document](/docs/concepts/networking/bluetooth_architecture.md#host-bus) for more detail on bt-host.
