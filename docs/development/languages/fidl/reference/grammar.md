# FIDL grammar

## Modified BNF rules

This is the grammar for FIDL source files. The grammar is expressed in a
modified BNF format.

A nonterminal symbol matches a sequence of other symbols, delimited by
commas.

```
nonterminal = list , of , symbols ;
```

Some symbols are terminals, which are either in all caps or are in
double quotes.

```
another-nonterminal = THESE , ARE , TERMINALS , AND , SO , IS , "this" ;
```

Alternation is expressed with a pipe.

```
choice = this | that | the-other ;
```

An option (zero or one) is expressed with parentheses.

```
optional = ( maybe , these ) , but , definitely , these ;
```

Repetition (zero or more) is expressed with parentheses and a star.

```
zero-or-more = ( list-part )* ;
```

Repetition (one or more) is expressed with parentheses and a plus.

```
one-or-more = ( list-part )+ ;

```

## Tokens

Whitespace and comments are ignored during lexing, and thus not
present in the following grammar. Comments are C++-style `//` until
the end of the line.

TODO(US-238): Eventually comments will be read as part of a
documentation generation system.

## Grammar

`file` is the starting symbol.

```

----------

### NOTE 1
The `enum-declaration` allows the more liberal `type-constructor` in the
grammar, but the compiler limits this to signed or unsigned integer types,
see [primitives].

### NOTE 2
The `bits-declaration` allows the more liberal `type-constructor` in the grammar, but the compiler
limits this to unsigned integer types, see [primitives].

### NOTE 3
The `bits-or-enum-member-value` allows the more liberal `literal` in the grammar, but the compiler limits this to:

* A `NUMERIC-LITERAL` in the context of an `enum`;
* A `NUMERIC-LITERAL` which must be a power of two, in the context of a `bits`.

### NOTE 4
The `protocol-method` error stanza allows the more liberal `type-constructor`
in the grammar, but the compiler limits this to an `int32`, `uint32`, or
an enum thereof.

### NOTE 5
Attributes cannot be placed on a reserved member.

### NOTE 6
The `service-member` allows the more liberal `type-constructor` in the grammar, but the compiler
limits this to protocols.
