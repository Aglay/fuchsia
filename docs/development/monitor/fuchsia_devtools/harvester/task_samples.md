# Task samples

The [Harvester](README.md) gathers task samples from jobs, processes, and
threads on the Fuchsia device. This document describes how the data is labelled
and what the values represent.

## Dockyard path

The path to each sample includes `koid`, the kernel object ID (koid), and the
sample name. For example, `koid:12345:zircon-services`.

## Samples

Data collected by the Harvester along with timestamp and a Dockyard path is
called a sample. The following sections describe Task samples collected. They
are presented in three groups, some values (for example, name) appear in
multiple groups.

### Job

A job has permissions. A job has one or more processes (which have memory
mappings), and each process has one or more thread (which execute on a CPU).

#### koid:\*:type

This is always `dockyard::KoidType::JOB` for a job.

#### koid:\*:parent_koid

The koid of the object that started this job.

#### koid:\*:name

A UTF-8 string label for the job. May not be unique.

#### koid:\*:kill_on_oom

If the Fuchsia device is low on memory (that is, oom or Out Of Memory), this job
(and its child processes and their threads) may be 'killed' (that is,
terminated) for the good of the rest of the system. For example, the job is not
critical. A Boolean value, 1 is true (will be killed) and 0 is false.

### Process

A process has memory. In contrast, a thread accesses memory owned by the
Process, but threads themselves don't have their own (memory) address range.

A byte of memory is considered committed if it's backed by physical memory. Some
of the memory may be double-mapped, and thus double-counted. Samples where this
may occur are marked "May be counted by more than one mapping" below.

#### koid:\*:type

This is always `dockyard::KoidType::PROCESS` for a process.

#### koid:\*:parent_koid

The koid of the object that started this process (for example, its job).

#### koid:\*:name

A UTF-8 string label for the job. May not be unique.

#### koid:\*:memory_mapped_bytes

The total size of mapped memory ranges in the process, though not all is backed
by physical memory.

#### koid:\*:memory_private_bytes

Committed memory that is only mapped into this process. May be counted by more
than one mapping.

#### koid:\*:memory_shared_bytes

Committed memory that is mapped into this and at least one other process. May be
counted by more than one mapping.

#### koid:\*:memory_scaled_shared_bytes

An estimate of the prorated number of `mem_shared_bytes` used by this process.

Calculated by:

For each shared, committed byte,

```none
memory_scaled_shared_bytes += 1 / (number of process mapping this byte)`
```

`memory_scaled_shared_bytes` is smaller than `memory_shared_bytes`. May be
counted by more than one mapping.

See `zx_info_task_stats_t` in `zircon/system/public/zircon/syscalls/object.h`
for up-to-date information.

### Thread

A thread exists within a process and each process will have at least one thread.
Threads actually execute (use the CPU) while a process does not.

A thread does not have its own memory address space. Instead threads use the
memory address space of their parent process.

#### koid:\*:type

This is always `dockyard::KoidType::THREAD` for a thread.

#### koid:\*:parent_koid

The koid of the object that started this thread (for example, its process).

#### koid:\*:name

A UTF-8 string label for the job. May not be unique.

#### koid:\*:thread_state

Whether the thread is running, waiting, and so on. The current (when this was written)
thread states are:

```none
Basic thread states, in zx_info_thread_t.state.
    ZX_THREAD_STATE_NEW                 0x0000
    ZX_THREAD_STATE_RUNNING             0x0001
    ZX_THREAD_STATE_SUSPENDED           0x0002
    // ZX_THREAD_STATE_BLOCKED is never returned by itself.
    // It is always returned with a more precise reason.
    // See ZX_THREAD_STATE_BLOCKED_* below.
    ZX_THREAD_STATE_BLOCKED             0x0003
    ZX_THREAD_STATE_DYING               0x0004
    ZX_THREAD_STATE_DEAD                0x0005

More precise thread states.
    ZX_THREAD_STATE_BLOCKED_EXCEPTION   0x0103
    ZX_THREAD_STATE_BLOCKED_SLEEPING    0x0203
    ZX_THREAD_STATE_BLOCKED_FUTEX       0x0303
    ZX_THREAD_STATE_BLOCKED_PORT        0x0403
    ZX_THREAD_STATE_BLOCKED_CHANNEL     0x0503
    ZX_THREAD_STATE_BLOCKED_WAIT_ONE    0x0603
    ZX_THREAD_STATE_BLOCKED_WAIT_MANY   0x0703
    ZX_THREAD_STATE_BLOCKED_INTERRUPT   0x0803
    ZX_THREAD_STATE_BLOCKED_PAGER       0x0903
```

See `zircon/system/public/zircon/syscalls/object.h` for an up-to-date reference.

### Channel

A channel provides a means of FIDL communication between processes.

For each pair of processes using channels for IPC, a pair of channels is
created. Channels are always created by the kernel in pairs. Two channels
can be tied together using the koid of the peer channel.

#### koid:\*:type

This is always `dockyard::KoidType::CHANNEL` for a channel.

#### koid:\*:process

`*` refers to the koid of the process that holds the channel.

#### koid:\*:peer

`*` refers to the koid of the channel that communicates with this channel.
Normally there is a complementary entry referring back to this channel.
