# Inspecting memory in zxdb

Zxdb supports the following commands for inspecting memory:

  * `aspace`: Show mapped memory regions.

  * `mem-analyze`: Dumps memory, trying to interpret pointers.

  * `mem-read` / `x`: Dumps memory

  * `stack`: Provides a low-level analysis of the stack. This is a handy
    command for low-level debugging.

  * `sym-near`: Figure out which symbol corresponds to an address.
