# Busy Beavers

This is a repository of projects that you can chip in on.
These projects are all designed so you can get up and running quickly.
Theyâ€™re easy to start, easy to stop, easy to resume.
They are great whether you're looking to make your first changes, looking to
spend some idle time doing something useful, want to ramp up your community
contributions, or you're just feeling generous.

Last but not least, each project makes a great starting point for a team fixit.

## Choosing a project

Use the left-side navigation pane to select a project from a category.
Pick a category by topics that you're familiar with or would like to learn more
about, and then pick a project that you fancy, then pick up a pickaxe and start
picking at it.

## Adding new projects

Anyone can add a project by sending a change to introduce new pages and sections
under this directory. Consult the `OWNERS` file to find someone to review and
approve your change. Reviewers will typically suggest helpful tips for making
your project more effective, but don't act as gatekeepers. Gates open, come on
in.

You'll have an easier time if you start by cloning the [template](template.md).

## Becoming a Busy Beaver reviewer

If you're like to help review new projects then please add yourself to the
`OWNERS` file and send the change to one of the existing owners.
