# Fuchsia RFC process

The Fuchsia RFC process is intended to provide a consistent and transparent path
for making project-wide, technical decisions. For example, the RFC process can
be used to evolve the project roadmap and the system architecture.

The RFC process is detailed in [RFC-0001: Fuchsia Request for Comments process](0001_rfc_process.md), along with [RFC-0006: Addendum of the RFC process for Zircon](0006_addendum_to_rfc_process_for_zircon.md).

## Summary of the process

- Review [criteria for requiring an RFC](#criteria).
- Socialize your idea.
- Draft your RFC using this [template](TEMPLATE.md).
- Iterate your idea with appropriate stakeholders.
- After stakeholders signoff, email eng-council@fuchsia.dev to prompt the Eng Council to decide whether to accept your RFC.
- If your RFC is accepted, a member of the Eng Council will comment on your change stating that the RFC is accepted, will assign the RFC a number and mark your change Code-Review +2. Your RFC can now be landed.

## Criteria for requiring an RFC {#criteria}

Criteria for requiring an RFC is detailed in [RFC-0001](0001_rfc_process.md).

The following kinds of changes must use the RFC process.

- Changing the project roadmap
- Adding constraints on future development
- Making project policy

- Delegating decision-making authority
- Escalations

In addition, changes in the source directories:

- /zircon
- /src/zircon
- /src/bringup

that meet the following criteria must use the RFC process as described in [RFC0006: Addendum of the RFC Process for Zircon](0006_addendum_to_rfc_process_for_zircon.md).

- Adding or removing Zircon system interfaces.
- Changing resource handling behaviors.
- Modifying isolation guarantees.
- Significant changes of performance or memory use.
- Favoring a single platform.
- Adding or Downgrading support for a platform.
- New build configurations.
