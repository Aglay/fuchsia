# Rust bindings

## Generating FIDL Rust crates

A FIDL Rust crate can be generated from a FIDL library in two ways:

1. Manually, using the
   [standard FIDL toolchain](/docs/development/languages/fidl/guides/cli.md).
2. Automatically,
   [using the Fuchsia build system](/docs/development/languages/rust/fidl_crates.md)
   (which under the hood uses the standard FIDL toolchain). This option is only
   available within the Fuchsia source tree.

## Libraries {#libraries}

A FIDL `library` maps to a Rust library crate named `fidl_`, followed by the
full library path with underscores instead of dots.

For example, given the `library` declaration:

```fidl
library games.tictactoe;
```

The corresponding FIDL crate is named `fidl_games_tictactoe`.

## Constants {#constants}

Given the [constants][lang-constants]:

```fidl
const uint8 BOARD_SIZE = 9;
const string NAME = "Tic-Tac-Toe";
```

The FIDL toolchain generates the following constants:

* `pub const BOARD_SIZE: u8`
* `pub const NAME: &str`

The correspondence between FIDL primitive types and Rust types is outlined in
[built-in types](#builtins).

## Fields

This section describes how the FIDL toolchain converts FIDL types to native
types in Rust. These types can appear as members in an aggregate type or as
parameters to a protocol method.

### Built-in types {#builtins}

Note: In Rust, the equivalent type for a nullable FIDL type `T?` is an `Option`
of the Rust type for `T`. These are not explicitly listed in the table below.

In following table, when both an "owned" and "borrowed" variant are specified,
the "owned" type refers to the type that would appear in an aggregate type (e.g.
as the type of a struct field or vector element), and the "borrowed" type refers
to the type that would appear if it were used as a protocol method parameter
(from the client's perspective) or response tuple value (from the server's
perspective). The distinction between owned and borrowed exists in order to take
advantage of Rustâ€™s ownership model. When making a request with a parameter of
type `T`, the [proxied function call](#protocols-client) does not need to take
ownership of `T` so the FIDL toolchain needs to generate a borrowed version of
`T`. Borrowed versions often use `&mut` since the type `T` may contain handles,
in which case the FIDL bindings zero out the handles when encoding which
modifies the input. Using `&mut` instead of taking ownership allows callers to
reuse the input value if it does not contain handles.

|FIDL Type|Rust Type|
|--- |--- |
|`bool`|`bool`|
|`int8`|`i8`|
|`int16`|`i16`|
|`int32`|`i32`|
|`int64`|`i64`|
|`uint8`|`u8`|
|`uint16`|`u16`|
|`uint32`|`u32`|
|`uint64`|`u64`|
|`float32`|`f32`|
|`float64`|`f64`|
|`array:N`|`&mut [T; N]` *(borrowed)*<br> `[T, N]` *(owned)*|
|`vector:N`|`&[T]` *(borrowed, when T is a numeric primitive)*<br> `&mut dyn ExactSizeIterator` *(borrowed)*<br>`Vec` *(owned)*|
|`string`|`&str` *(borrowed)*<br>`String` *(owned)*|
|`request`|`fidl::endpoints::ServerEnd<PMarker>`, *where `PMarker` is the [marker type](#protocols) for this protocol.*|
|`P`|`fidl::endpoints::ClientEnd<PMarker>` *where `PMarker` is the [marker type](#protocols) for this protocol.*|
|`handle`|`fidl::Handle`|
|`handle`|The corresponding handle type is used. For example,`fidl::Channel` or `fidl::Vmo`|


#### User defined types {#user-defined-types}

bits,enums, and tables are always referred to using their generated type `T`.
structs and unions  can be either non-nullable or nullable, and used in an owned
context or borrowed context, which means that there are four possible equivalent
Rust types. For a given `struct T` or `union T`, the types are as follows:

||owned|borrowed|
|--- |--- |--- |
|non-nullable|`T`|`&mut T`|
|nullable|`Option<T>`|`Option<&mut T>`|

### Request, response, and event parameters {#request-response-event-parameters}

When FIDL needs to generate a single Rust type representing the parameters to a
request, response, or event, such as for [result types](#protocols-client), it
uses the following rules:

* Multiple parameters are represented as a tuple of the parameter types.
* A single parameter is represented just using the parameter's type.
* An empty set of parameters is represented using the unit type `()`.

## Types {#types}

### Bits {types-bits}

Given the [bits][lang-bits] definition:

```fidl
bits FileMode : uint16 {
    READ = 0b001;
    WRITE = 0b010;
    EXECUTE = 0b100;
};
```

The FIDL toolchain generates an equivalent set of
[bitflags](https://fuchsia-docs.firebaseapp.com/rust/bitflags/index.html) called
`FileMode` with flags `FileMode::Read`, `FileMode::Write`, and
`FileMode::Execute`. Bits members using screaming snake case are converted to
camel case in the generated Rust code.

The generated `bitflags` struct always has the complete set of [`[#derive]`
 rules](#derives).

### Enums {#types-enums}

Given the [enum][lang-enum] definition:

```fidl
enum Color {
    RED = 1;
    GREEN = 2;
    BLUE = 3;
};
```

The FIDL toolchain generates an equivalent Rust `enum` using the specified
underlying type, or `u32` if none is specified:

```rust
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, Eq, PartialEq, Ord, PartialOrd, Hash)]
#[repr(u32)]
pub enum Color {
    Red = 1,
    Green = 2,
    Blue = 3,
}
```

With the following methods:

* `from_primitive(prim: u32) -> Option<Color>`: Returns `Some` of the enum
  variant corresponding to the discriminant value if any, and `None` otherwise.
* `into_primitive(&self) -> u32`: Returns the underlying discriminant value.

The generated `enum` always has the complete set of [`[#derive]` rules](#derives).

### Structs {#types-structs}

Given the [struct][lang-structs] declaration:

```fidl
struct Color {
    uint32 id;
    string name = "red";
};
```

The FIDL toolchain generates an equivalent Rust `struct`:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone, Eq, PartialEq, Ord, PartialOrd, Hash)]
pub struct Color {
    pub id: u32,
    pub name: String,
}
```

Note: The default values for struct members are not yet supported in the rust
bindings, and therefore do not affect the generated Rust `struct`.

The generated `Color` `struct` follows the [`[#derive]` rules](#derives).

### Unions {#types-unions}

Given the [union][lang-unions] definition:

```fidl
union JsonValue {
    1: reserved;
    2: int32 int_value;
    3: string string_value;
};
```

The FIDL toolchain generates an equivalent Rust `enum`:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Eq, PartialEq, Ord, PartialOrd, Hash)]
pub enum JsonValue {
    IntValue(i32),
    StringValue(String),
}
```

The generated `JsonValue` `enum` follows the [`[#derive]` rules](#derives).

#### Flexible unions

[Flexible unions][lang-unions] (that is, unions that are prefixed with the
`flexible` keyword in their FIDL definition) have an enum additional variant
generated to represent the case where the variant is unknown. This variant is
considered private - users should instead match against it with a catch all
case, which also ensures that adding new variants to a flexible union is source
compatible:

```rust
// this code will still compile if a new union variant is added
match json_value {
    JsonValue::IntValue(val) => ...,
    JsonValue::StringValue(val) => ...,
    _ => ..., // unknown variant
}
```

Encoding a union with an unknown variant writes the unknown data and the
original ordinal back onto the wire.

### Tables {#types-tables}

Given the table definition:

```table
table User {
    1: reserved;
    2: uint8 age;
    3: string name;
};
```

The FIDL toolchain generates a `struct` `User` where each member is optional:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
pub struct User {
  pub age: Option<u8>,
  pub name: Option<String>,
}
```

With the following methods:

* `empty() -> User`: Returns a new `User`, with each member initialized to
  `None`.

The generated `User` `struct` follows the [`[#derive]` rules](#derives).

<!-- TODO this should probably go in a guide -->
#### Table initialization {#table-initialization}

The recommended way of initializing a table is using the struct update syntax:

```rust
let user = User {
    age: Some(20),
    ..User::empty()
};
```
This prevents API breakage when new fields are added.

### Derives {#derives}

When the FIDL toolchain generates a new `struct` or `enum` for a FIDL type, it
attempts to `derive` as many traits from a predefined list of useful traits as
it can, including `Debug`, `Copy`, `Clone`, etc. The complete list of default
derived traits can be found in the [compiler source](/tools/fidl/fidlgen_rust/ir/ir.go#880).

For aggregate types, such as structs, unions, and tables, the set of derives is
determined by starting with the list of all possible derives and then removing
some based on the fields that are transitively present in the type. For example,
aggregate types that transitively contain a `vector` do not derive `Copy`, and
types that contain a `handle` do not derive `Copy` and `Clone`. Additionally,
arrays larger than 32 have no derives. When in doubt, refer to the generated
code to check which traits are derived by a specific type. The complete set of
rules can be found in
[`fillDerivesForSource`](/tools/fidl/fidlgen_rust/ir/ir.go#1188).

## Protocols {#protocols}

Given a [protocol][lang-protocols]:

```fidl
protocol TicTacToe {
    StartGame(bool start_first);
    MakeMove(uint8 row, uint8 col) -> (bool success, GameState? new_state);
    -> OnOpponentMove(GameState new_state);
};
```

Note: The `MakeMove` method above returns a bool representing success, and a
nullable response value. This is considered un-idiomatic, you should use an [error type](#protocols-results)
instead.

The main entrypoint for interacting with `TicTacToe` is the `TicTacToeMarker`
struct, which contains two associated types:

* `Proxy`: The associated proxy type for use with async clients. In this
  example, this is a generated `TicTacToeProxy` type. Synchronous clients should
  use `TicTacToeSynchronousProxy` directly (see
  [Synchronous](#protocols-client-synchronous)), which is not stored in an
  associated type on the `TicTacToeMarker`.
* `RequestStream`: The associated request stream that servers implementing this
  protocol will need to handle. In this example, this is
  `TicTacToeRequestStream`, which is generated by FIDL.

Additionally, `TicTacToeMarker` has the following associated constants:
* `DEBUG_NAME: &â€™static str`: The name of the service suitable for debug
  purposes

Other code may be generated depending on the [Protocol and method
attributes](#protocol-method-attributes) applied to the protocol or its methods.

### Client {#protocols-client}

#### Asynchronous {#protocols-client-asynchronous}

For asynchronous clients, the FIDL toolchain generates a `TicTacToeProxy` struct
with the following associated types:

Associated types:

* `TicTacToeProxy::MakeMoveResponseFut`: The `Future` type for the response of a
  two way method. This type implements `std::future::Future<Output =
  Result<(bool, Option<Box<GameState>>), fidl::Error>> + Send`.
* `FooProxy::OnOpponentMoveResponseFut`: The `Future` type for an incoming
  event. This type implements `std::future::Future<Output = Result<GameState,
  fidl::Error>> + Send`

Methods:

* `new(channel: fidl::AsyncChannel) -> TicTacToeProxy`: Create a new proxy for
  `TicTacToe`.
* `into_channel(self) -> Result<fidl::AsyncChannel>`: Attempt to convert the
  proxy back into a channel.
* `take_event_stream(&self) -> TicTacToeEventStream`: Get a `Stream` of events
  from the server end (see [Events](#protocols-events-client)).
* `start_game(&self, mut start_first: bool) -> Result<(), fidl::Error>`: Proxy
  method for a fire and forget protocol method. It takes as arguments the
  request parameters and returns an empty result.
* `make_move(&self, mut row: u8, mut col: u8) -> Self::MakeMoveResponseFut`:
  Proxy method for a two way method. It takes as arguments the request
  parameters and returns a `Future` of the response.

An example of setting up an asynchronous proxy is available in the Rust
tutorial.

#### Synchronous {#protocols-client-synchronous}

For synchronous clients of the `TicTacToe` protocols, the FIDL toolchain
generates a `TicTacToeSynchronousProxy` struct with the following methods:

* `new(channel: fidl::Channel) -> TicTacToeSynchronousProxy`: Returns a new
  synchronous proxy over the client end of a channel. The server end is assumed
  to implement the `TicTacToe` protocol.
* `into_channel(self) -> fidl::Channel`: Convert the proxy back into a channel.
* `start_game(&mut self, mut a: i64) -> Result<(), fidl::Error>`: Proxy method
  for a fire and forget method: it takes the request parameters as arguments and
  returns an empty result.
* `make_move(&mut self, mut row: u8, mut col: u8, __deadline: zx::Time) ->
  Result<(bool, Option<Box<GameState>>), fidl::Error>`: Proxy method for a two
  way method. It takes the request parameters as arguments followed by a
  deadline parameter which dictates how long the method call will wait for a
  response (or `zx::Time::INFINITE` to block indefinitely). It returns a
  `Result` of the [response parameters](#request-response-event-parameters).

An example of setting up a synchronous proxy is available in the Rust tutorial.

### Server {#protocols-server}

#### Protocol request stream {#protocol-request-stream}

To represent the stream of incoming requests to a server, the FIDL toolchain
generates a `TicTacToeRequestStream` type that implements `futures::Stream<Item
= Result<TicTacToeRequest, fidl::Error>>` as well as
`fidl::endpoints::RequestStream`. Each protocol has a corresponding request
stream type.

#### Request enum {#request-enum}

`TicTacToeRequest` is an enum representing the possible requests of the `Foo`
protocol. It has the following variants:

* `StartGame { start_first: bool, control_handle: TicTacToeControlHandle }`: A
  fire and forget request, which contains the request parameters and a control
  handle.
* `MakeMove { row: u8, col: u8, responder: TicTacToeMakeMoveResponder }`: A two
  way method request, which contains the request parameters and a responder.

One such enum is generated for each protocol.

#### Request responder {#request-responder}

Each two way method has a corresponding generated responder type which the
server uses to respond to a request. In this example, which only has one two way
method, the FIDL toolchain generates `TicTacToeMakeMoveResponder`, which
provides the following methods:

* `send(self, mut success: bool, mut new_state: Option<&mut GameState>) ->
  Result<(), fidl::Error>`: Sends a response.
* `send_no_shutdown_on_err(self, mut success: bool, mut new_state: Option<&mut
  GameState>) -> Result<(), fidl::Error>`: Similar to `send` but does not shut
  down the channel if an error occurs.
* `control_handle(&self) -> &TicTacToeControlHandle`: Get the underlying
  [control handle](#protocol-control-handle).
* `drop_without_shutdown(mut self)`: Drop the Responder without shutting down
  the channel.

#### Protocol control handle {#protocol-control-handle}

The FIDL toolchain generates `TicTacToeControlHandle` to encapsulate the client
endpoint of the `Foo` protocol on the server side. It contains the following
methods:

* `shutdown(&self)`: Shut down the channel.
* `shutdown_with_epitaph(&self, status: zx_status::Status)`: Send an epitaph and
  then shut down the channel.
* `send_on_opponent_move(&self, mut new_state: &mut GameState) -> Result<(),
  fidl::Error>`: Proxy method for an event, which takes as arguments the eventâ€™s
  parameters and returns an empty result (see
  [Events](#protocols-events-server)).

### Events {#protocols-events}

#### Client {#protocols-events-client}

For receiving events on the client, the FIDL toolchain generates a
`TicTacToeEventStream`, which can be obtained using the `take_event_stream()`
method on the [`FooProxy`](#protocols-client-asynchronous).
`TicTacToeEventStream` implements `futures::Stream<Item = Result<TicTacToeEvent,
fidl::Error>>`.

`TicTacToeEvent` is an enum representing the possible events. It has the
following variants:

* `OnOpponentMove { new_state: GameState }`: Discriminant for the `FooEvent`
  event.

And provides the following methods:

* `into_on_opponent_move(self) -> Option<GameState>`: Return `Some` of the
  [parameters](#request-response-event-parameters) of the event, or `None` if
  the variant does not match the method call.

#### Server {#protocols-events-server}

Servers can send events by using the [control handle](#protocol-control-handle)
corresponding to the protocol. The control handle can be obtained through a
`TicTacToeRequest` received from the client. For fire and forget methods, the
control handle is available through the `control_handle` field, and for two way
methods, it is available through the `control_handle()` method on the responder.
A control handle for a protocol can also be obtained through the corresponding
request stream (in this example, `TicTacToeRequestStream`), since it implements
`fidl::endpoints::RequestStream`.

### Results {#protocols-results}

For a method with an error type:

```fidl
protocol TicTacToe {
    MakeMove(uint8 row, uint8 col) -> (GameState new_state) error MoveError;
};
```

The FIDL toolchain generates a public `TicTacToeMakeMoveResult` type alias for
`std::result::Result<GameState, MoveError>`. The rest of the bindings code for
this method is generated as if it has a single response parameter `result` of
type `TicTacToeMakeMoveResult`. The type used for a successful result follows
the [parameter type conversion rules](#request-response-event-parameters).

### Protocol composition {#protocol-composition}

FIDL does not have a concept of inheritance, and generates full code as
described above for all [composed protocols][lang-protocol-composition]. In
other words, the code generated for the following:

```fidl
protocol A {
    Foo();
};

protocol B {
    compose A;
    Bar();
};
```

Is the same as the following code:

```fidl
protocol A {
    Foo();
};

protocol B {
    Foo();
    Bar();
};
```

### Protocol and method attributes {#protocol-method-attributes}

#### Transitional

The `"Transitional"` attribute does not affect the generated rust code.
Protocols that need to be transitioned can have implementation servers
temporarily use a catch-all match arm in the `Request` handler.

#### Discoverable

For protocols annotated with the `"Discoverable"` attribute, the Marker type
additionally implements the `fidl::endpoints::DiscoverableService` trait.
