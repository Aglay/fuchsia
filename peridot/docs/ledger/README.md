## What is Ledger?

Ledger is a distributed storage system for Fuchsia.

Each application (or more precisely, each [component]) running on behalf of a
particular user has a separate data store provided and managed by Ledger, and
vended to a client application by Fuchsia framework through its [component
context].

The data store for the particular component/user combination is private - not
accessible to other apps of the same user, and not accessible to other users of
the same app.

Each data store is transparently **synchronized** across devices of its user
through a [cloud provider]. Any data operations are made **offline-first** with
no coordination with the cloud. If concurrent modifications result in a data
conflict, the conflict is resolved using an app-configurable merge policy.

Each data store is organized into collections exposing a **key-value store** API
called *pages*. Page API supports storing data of arbitrary size, atomic changes
across multiple keys, snapshots and modification observers.
