### configure jiri to manage a specific petal

## usage: fx set-petal none|fuchsia|topaz
##
## "none" configures jiri to fetch all repos at the global integration version,
## and is the recommended default.
##
## Other values configure jiri to fetch that specific petal's repo at
## top-of-tree (HEAD) instead of the globally integration version. This means a
## "jiri update" will pull down committed but not yet integrated changes, which
## will be faster but may be less stable.
