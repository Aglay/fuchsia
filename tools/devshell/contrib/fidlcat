### run fidlcat on given target.

## Runs fidlcat in the given configuration; currently, fidlcat logs all FIDL
## chatter from the given target executable.  Starts the debug agent on the
## proposed target, and closes the debug agent on exit.
##
## CAUTION: This support is experimental, and invocation strategy is likely to
## change.  The component launching configuration is *especially* likely to go
## away over time.
##
## TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS:
##
## - Remember to use "fx set-device" when working with multiple devices.
## - This scripts by default will mute the SSH connection stdout/stderr, so any
##   errors triggered by it won't appear. Use the --verbose-agent flag to see
##   the output.
## - This scripts uses the tool "nc" for testing TCP connections. Check that it
##   is in $PATH and that it works.
##
## Usage: fx fidlcat [(--port|-p) <PORT>] [--remote-pid <pid>|run <component URL>]
##
##    --port            Port the debug agent will be listening on. Will use 2345
##                      by default.
##    --verbose-agent   Whether the debug agent's stdout/stderr should be shown.
##    --remote-pid      The koid of the remote process to trace
##    run               a token indicating that you want to invoke and trace the
##                      following component URL.
##
## Flags after -- are parsed by fidlcat.  Example usage:
##
## # Attaches to the process with the given pid on the target:
## fx fidlcat --remote-pid 4755
##
## # Launches the echo client, and monitors its FIDL chatter:
## fx fidlcat run fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/echo_client_cpp#meta/echo_client_cpp.cmx
