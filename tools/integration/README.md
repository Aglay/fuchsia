# Fuchsia's Integration Interface: fint

Fuchsia's _integration interface_ is the interface between the Fuchsia platform
and any infrastructure that builds and tests Fuchsia. It is encapsulated as the
interface of the tool _fint_ (/'fÉªnt/, **f**uchsia **int**egration).

TODO(fxbug.dev/10428, fxbug.dev/10429): fint is under simulateous and iterative
design and developement. As it is extended, keep its interface documented and
up-to-date here.
