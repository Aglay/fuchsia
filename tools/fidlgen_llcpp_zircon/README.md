## Generated FIDL Low-Level C++ Bindings

Because of BLD-427 and BLD-353 blocking invoking `fidlgen` from the zircon build,
we intend to check in copies of llcpp bindings for select FIDL libraries,
as a workaround, to support limited use of llcpp.

Each checked in library can be referenced similar to the C bindings, e.g. whereas one would write
`"$zx/system/fidl/fuchsia-mem:c"` to get the auto-generated C FIDL bindings, the llcpp version is
`"$zx/system/fidl/fuchsia-mem:llcpp"`.

When using it in source code, whereas one would write `#include <fuchsia/mem/c/fidl.h>` to import
the C bindings header, the corresponding llcpp directive would be
`#include <fuchsia/mem/llcpp/fidl.h>`.

To regenerate all the bindings, simply run the following command:
```bash
fx build -k 0 tools/fidlgen_llcpp_zircon:update
```
The `-k 0` switches would keep the build going even if parts of zircon failed to build.

[TODO(yifeit): Implement] As extra precaution measure, the full build will validate that the
generated bindings are up-to-date. You may manually run the same check with the following command:
```bash
fx build tools/fidlgen_llcpp_zircon:validate
```
