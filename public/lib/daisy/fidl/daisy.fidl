// 1) It directly or indirectly provides type constraints for nouns (arguments
// passed to/from a Module instance) during the process of Module Resolution.

// derived, to initialize a Module after it has been selected through Module
// Resolution.

  // object with a "@type" attribute and other associated data.  TODO(thatguy):
  // We need to decide if we want to keep this in place, or deprecate this
  // eventually and move entirely to using Entity references.
  //
  // DEPRECATED: Use |entity_reference|.

  // Set this if you want to explicitly define this noun's allowed types. This
  // is also useful in the cases where the noun has a 'direction' of type
  // 'output', and you wish to set the allowable output types from the Module
  // (see docs/modular/manifests/verb_template.md for a definition of
  // 'direction').
  //
  // Only one entry in |entity_type| must match the constraint specified by
  // the Module for the constraint to be considered satisfied.
