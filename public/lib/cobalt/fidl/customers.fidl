module cobalt;

// Cobalt allows projects to record and report on metrics. This file contains
// ids registered with Cobalt for particular projects, metrics and their
// encodings. Metrics and encodings are defined in the config.h file and
// in registed_metrics.txt and registered_encodings.txt the Cobalt repo.

// A project is an app or set of apps which record a set of metrics.
// A metric is something that is measured or tracked by a particular project.
// An encoding describes the way an observation is to be sent.
// Encodings limit the type and value that the observation can take.
// The relationship between metrics and encodings is many-to-many. Each metric
// could be encoded in many different ways and each encoding could be used for
// many different metrics.

// Ids for projects that use Cobalt within Fuchsia.
