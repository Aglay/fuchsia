library modular;

// An application that is meant to be run as a Module in a Story just requests
// the ModuleContext service from its service namespace. It should implement the
// ViewProvider and the Lifecycle services, but if it doesn't it can still be
// run in a story.
//
// When ModuleContext.StartModule() is invoked, the Module component is
// instantiated and can start running. The story runner will request its
// ViewProvider service in order to display its UI.
//
// If a Module component implements the |Lifecycle| interface, then invocation
// of the Terminate() method on its |Lifecycle| service is a signal that it
// should stop. If the Module application does not implement the |Lifecycle|
// interface, the component instance is simply terminated in order to stop it.
//
// A Module instance may be stopped for the following reasons:
//
// (1) StoryController.Stop() is called to stop the whole story. A plausible
//     occasion for this to happen is that the UserShell dismisses the story, or
//     that the user logs out.
//
// (2) ModuleController.Stop() is called by the caller that started this Module
//     instance. A plausible occasion for this to happen is that the StoryShell
//     dismisses the module or that the parent module wants it to stop.
//
// Other connections the Module instance may hold, such as to Link, LinkWatcher,
// ModuleController of other Module instances, are closed after
// Lifecycle.Terminate() is called.
