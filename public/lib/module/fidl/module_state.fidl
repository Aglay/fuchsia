library modular;

// State used to notify ModuleWatcher about state transitions of a
// Module instance. This is very similar to the StoryState, however
// it's not entirely the same and hence a separate type. The
// ModuleState of the root module mostly drives the StoryState of the
// whole story, but in the future we expect them to diverge more.
// Right now, a module cannot have an INITIAL state, because it's
// started as soon as it is created, and it gets deleted as soon as it
// reaches the STOPPED state, whileas a story can be restarted.
//
// Currently possible state transitions (and the events that cause
// them) are:
//
//            -> RUNNING     ModuleContext.StartModule() or StoryController.AddModule()
//   RUNNING  -> UNLINKED    Module connection closed immediately
//   RUNNING  -> STOPPED     ModuleController.Stop() or StoryController.Stop()
//   UNLINKED -> STOPPED     (same)
//   RUNNING  -> ERROR       application exits
//   UNLINKED -> ERROR       (same)
//
enum ModuleState {
  // Module instance called Ready() on its Story handle.
  RUNNING = 2;
  // Module closed the connection on its Module interface request.
  // This is fine, because any application can be run as a module,
  // even one that does not implement the Module service. The module
  // then does not participate in Story based data flow (through Link)
  // and life cycle (through Story.Done() and Module.Stop()), but
  // that's just fine. The application of an UNLINKED module should
  // still not exit on its own, this will be notified as ERROR.
  // TODO(mesch): Presumably there could be more general ways for
  // arbitrary applications to benefit from Story, Link, Legder
  // services than to implement one specific interface. That the root
  // module of a story becomes UNLINKED doesn't affect the state of
  // the Story; that remains RUNNING either way.
  UNLINKED = 6;
  // Module instance is stopped after Module.Stop(). The module can
  // now close its connection without transition to ERROR. No further
  // transitions are to be expected. An UNLINKED module transitions
  // here directly on Story.Stop() or ModuleController.Stop() without
  // going through Module.Stop().
  STOPPED = 4;
  // Connection to the Module instance was closed without Stop()
  // request. No further transitions are to be expected.
  ERROR = 5;
