    //    device becoming known on this device for the first time.
    //
    //  * Every time the StoryState of the story changes on this device. The
    //    StoryState on another device of a story known on this device is not made
    //    known on this device.
    //
    //  * Every time the StoryVisibilityState of the story changes on this device.

    // * After the story record of a story is deleted from the current device by
    //   an invocation of StoryProvider.DeleteStory() on the current device.
