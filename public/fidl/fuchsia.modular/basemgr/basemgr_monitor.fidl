// This service is provided to the boot environment by the
// basemgr_monitor component. When basemgr starts it connects to
// this service in its environment and asks it for the number of
// connections it current has. If the number is not one, or the
// connection cannot be made, basemgr exits.
//
// Later we can use this service to send basemgr remote control
// commands from a terminal, such as asking it to change its user
// shell. It could also be folded into appmgr or sysmgr. We play with
// it a bit first.
//
// We use :: in the service name because it's more usual in
// sysmgr/services.conf.
