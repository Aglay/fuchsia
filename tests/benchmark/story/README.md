This benchmark runs everything related to a story. For a while, this could well
be the only thing to benchmark around the framework at all, as everything the
framework does has to do with stories. We might add other benchmarks later, and
for the sheer possibility of that it is that this benchmark has a name of its
own.

We keep log output of past executions in RUNLOG so we can track evolution of
numbers.
