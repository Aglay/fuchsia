# launchpad

[launchpad][launchpad] is a Magenta library that provides the
functionality to create and start new processes (including loading ELF
binaries, passing initial RPC messages needed by runtime init, etc).
It is a low-level library and over time it is expected that few pieces
of code will make direct use of it.

Launchpad is designed to give complete control over the creation of a
new Process. This includes:
- The executable code that will be loaded into the process.
- The initial Handle table of the process.
- The initial set of [file descriptors](libc.md#fds) in the process.
- The process's view into filesystems.
- The unix environment (as in getenv and setenv) of the process.

There is extensive documentation about launchpad in [its primary
header file][launchpad-header].
