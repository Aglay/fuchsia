### build a test package and run on target.
### PKG_TARGET is fully qualified or under fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/

## usage: fx run-test PKG_TARGET [runtests flags]
## Builds the specified test package (e.g., appmgr_integration_tests), copies it to the
## target, and executes it.
##
## If using this command, please run 'fx build' again before paving your device
## because 'fx build updates' used by this script does not build images so it
## can leave paver in weird state.
##
## Arguments:
##   All arguments are passed directly to `runtests`, see `fx run-test -h` for all flags.
