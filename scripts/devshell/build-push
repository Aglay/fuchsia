### build Fuchsia and push to device

## usage: fx build-push [ninja option,...] [target,...]
##
## Build ALL targets. After building all the targets, push the ones that were
## supplied to this command. If no targets were specified push all of them.
## The packages are pushed to the device specified. If no device is supplied
## explicitly this will push to the single connected device. If multiple devices
## are connected and no device is specified, pushing will fail.
